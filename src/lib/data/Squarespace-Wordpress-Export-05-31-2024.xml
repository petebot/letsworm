  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Señor Flórma sits in a terri-cloth trench coat fresh out of Creme Brulé. His threaded rubber sweater is catching on his chest hairs. <em>What ever happened to function?</em>&nbsp;he wonders, dipping the big toe of his croissant in what is left of the black coffee he purchased thirty minutes ago.&nbsp;Ordering the cup was an attempt to feel warm, to dry off, to be inspired. &nbsp;Now it is room temp and undesirable. Señor Flórma is knuckling up. It's gonna be a long day and these pants are too tight to endure any further croissants.</p>

      <title>A Pack of Wild Krags</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2017/4/20/a-pack-of-wild-krags</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Krags are sharp toothed nasties with hair like scales running down their bodies. They have pointy ears and bright white eyes. The coats on this pack are oil-black. They walk on all fours. Their claws rip the surface beneath them. They keep a pinky finger extended up when feeding to show what rascals they are, like a crawler’s antenna surveying while their head is down in the meat. There is an abundance of drool. You don’t want to run into a pack of wild krags walking in the forest. &nbsp;It is known to be bad business.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As they sneer, snarl, and circle the travelers the women and the men, huddle together in fear, sheltering one another in a collected mass. The scientist looks at the alpha-beastie and comes to a startling realization: t<em>hat krag can count</em>. Of course he has no idea what the beast is called, or what the word for count is here on this planet, and no way of communicating this to anyone but his useless and limp companions, but the beast’s darting eyes tell its whole story.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The scientist is correct in his diagnosis. The krag in question has been frantically counting the fallen leaves on this particular section of forest floor for weeks, methodically finding patterns that don’t match up, variations in greens, yellows, and reds, that he hopes to thread through the story of how possibly to ascertain a total number, something to calm his restless mind. &nbsp;He isn’t thinking meat, meat, meat, or kill, kill, kill at all, he’s seeing the feet of these seven travelers stepping over the pattern of <em>leaves, leaves, leaves</em> that he’s been tracing. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This krag, it turns out, has had a pretty rough year. Tough times fell on his family, first with the loss of his accounting position in the pack, and then the failed hunt he led which resulted in the death of a kraggle cub. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Once a vital member in his pack - he could scout a field or clearing for possible scribblers and their various entryways and exit-ways, where the plump little morsels sought shelter, how they scattered, whichever many went whatever way and when - whether they spooked from sounds, scents, or sights. He’d survey large pockets of the forest before any hunting expeditions took place, determining the pace of scurrying scribbler and the distance from proper cover a krag would need to make a winning pounce. He’d report to his employer, a larger, darker, toothier krag, on all the details . &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And then the fateful day, a plotted expedition on the calendar, weeks of work on his part, goes horribly wrong. The krags enter the community of scribblers, under cover of night. The place is barren. Not a scribbler in sight. As he surveyed in stealth the scribblers got wise, packed their squibbles and migrated to a fresh patch of mulch and mold.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">His employer bit a nip off his ear, used his pinky finger claw to mark the accountant and punish him. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And now here he is, leading a pack of strays, smaller than a normal pack of kraggles. And sure enough, he’s a brute, losing his temper at those who follow him, losing himself in the counting while thirsting for the hunt, and threatening his position among the others. He doesn’t trust his accountant. She’s unfocused. He’s recounting her counts. They’re going in circles. His eyes in a frenzy. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is in these wild eyes the scientist sees their way out. He, his cohorts, and the women from the trees aren’t what is being hunted. Oh, they’re certainly hungry, but mostly the pack is in the middle of a broader existential crisis. &nbsp;</p>

      <title>Cave by the Sea</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2017/4/27/cave-by-the-sea</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Clara is in a cave by the sea. The tide rises, fills the cave floor, washes over the small beach and algae covered rocks. It erases the sand castles she spent the morning constructing, melts the bridges she allowed Enrique to traverse between turret-topped towers. &nbsp;She climbs further up the red rock wall. She pets the gecko that lives in her pocket tee, her thumb rubbing its smooth little head, its eyes close hazily from the pressure. “Time for a nap Enrique,” she says to the lizard, wondering if it is vaguely racist that she calls him Enrique, though she much prefers it to Todd. Clara bites the free edge of her thumbnail off and feeds it to her pocket. Enrique snips it up. “We gotta get out of here, professor,” she says to an abandoned floor lamp next to her, hoping to make light of a life-threatening tidal rise. “The floor lamp is unamused, as floor lamps tend to be,” she mutters to the lizard, who is already asleep. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Clara makes a list of words that begin with the letter <em>R</em>. &nbsp;She begins with <em>rope</em>, which she has, then she thinks, <em>rope knots</em>, which she doesn’t know how to make. &nbsp;She is frustrated. She thinks of <em>rage</em>. Then she thinks <em>red vines</em>, but what she would prefer to eat is a twizzler. There is a crack in the <em>rock-wall</em> to her left. She thinks <em>rock climb </em>but these aren’t the <em>right shoes</em>. The sunset outside the cave can be traced in the shadows from the round skylight that forms atop the cave like a volcano. <em>Rapscallion</em>, she thinks, because a boy is what she was chasing as she snorkeled away from the group, tugging Enrique in a plate sized buoy above her. &nbsp;<em>Rut</em>, that’s what this is, a continuous pattern that she is held in. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But you’re in paradise,” says the lamp to Clara. &nbsp;“Look at this cave. The lines on these walls predate your entire existence.&nbsp;Now, isn’t that great?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She fiddles with a pebble, worrying it between her thumb and forefinger. &nbsp;She sees a <em>ripple </em>in its wake<em>.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I think my life is a mistake,” she says to the lamp.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“There aren’t mistakes. There are only paths. You are on this path. You are on this path until you reach the next one. You can decide to stop or you can hoist me up to that hole there, and hook me to the rock. You can climb me right back into existing. You can take me home, refresh my bulb, polish my brass, plug me into the wall. We’ll start a life together.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She grabs the lamp by its neck.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Rutherford Kensington, of the <em>Kensington</em> Kensingtons was off for a swim. In his head Rutherford was never late to a thing because he was always precisely on time, in that, when picturing his place in the universe, Rutherford is always exactly where he says he is, no sooner or later than he need be there. Thus before the ambulance,&nbsp;before the whistle, before purchasing pre-swim crisps, before even walking into the Leisure Centre where he certainly had all the time in the world to disrobe and climb into his swimmers, in Rutherford’s mind, every step was a step towards the cinderblock, which was meant to break its fall on his face. The woman who gave Rutherford reason to pause, as he ogled her swinging arms as she strutted by, placed him directly in the path of the falling cement brick from the much-in-need-of-repair facade of the unseasonably humid and particularly chlorinated lap pool at precisely the time he was meant to be there. And that is why, as soon as he is out of this facial cast, and out of this sterile hospital room, where all the jello is green and all the juice is apple, he will find her, and tell her they were meant to meet one another, just as a cinderblock was meant to meet his face. &nbsp;</p>

They inspected the body. They licked their boy clean with their thick dry tongues. They didn’t notice at first, he looked like his siblings. &nbsp;His tail was coiled up, beneath him, his beak broke through the shell. He made the sound a nip makes. Everything was as it was supposed to be. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Years would pass before he stumbled upon this place. Years would pass before he fit into the cap. Years would pass before they realized his feet had no webbing. For years it would be whispered in his ears. Others would make direct eye contact before saying it, nodding gravely at him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When he arrives in the rock pasture, the voices that have filled his lifetime reawaken in his mind,&nbsp; repeating and repeating the familiar phrase, “You are the one, Galanok.”</p>

      <title>Electronic Milk</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2017/5/5/electronic-milk</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sheila wants to call it <em>electronic milk</em>. “But you’re describing the extraction system,” he said, “the milk itself is not electronic.” Malcolm sits in the conference room hovering over a white bowl of raspberries. He looks at his knees beneath the charcoal glass of the long table where he remains many minutes after the meeting. He dips his fingers into the bowl, plucks a soft morsel, its bulbous fuzzy exterior held up by his gentle grip. He thinks of Sheila’s head in his hands, about squeezing the berry. He’s not mad at Sheila necessarily, though it is her voice he hears in his head leading the pack in misunderstanding the product, he’s just tired of explaining the differences.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"<em>Electronic</em> cannot be the right adjective, even if it sounds <em>cool</em>. The product is about flavor, the different varieties of milk now able to be naturally made within the beasts before the extraction even takes place. &nbsp;We are milking flavored milk!” he shouted, his fists slammed against the glass table quieting the room, “the regular stuff has been cultivated electronically for years!" Malcolm cannot remember the last time he had a glass of milk. He remembers it fondly, dipping a dark chocolate cookie into a thick white puddle. He squeezes the berry between his teeth, plucks another from the bowl.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The title will go all the way to the top. His name will be associated with it, it’s his team’s account. Malcolm is tired of the glass walls of this city. He anxiously scissors his knees beneath the table. He is tired of arguing over adjectives. Proper usage is losing its grip. These new girls are wrestling over power and ruining language. They’re toppling over one another to claim victory. They’re not listening to him anymore. He is on a path to extinction, the sole man in the office, the only one that’s over forty. He cannot keep up with <em>synergy</em>. He holds the berry up and looks at the frosted follicles surrounding the little chandelier’s bulbs, and squeezes it flat with his fingers. <em>Wouldn’t it be nice from time to time</em>, he thinks,<em> to set the world on fire. &nbsp;</em></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Quite startled at the flyer’s sudden appearance, its talons thudding against the meadow, its wide eyes spying, the worm darted around and spoke.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You are not supposed to be here,” it said.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You,” said the flyer, “are not supposed to be here either. And what, may I ask, is that music?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The worm smirked in the flyer’s direction and said, “This? Oh <em>this</em> is the good stuff!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Eat or dance?</em> This is the question the owl presently asks herself. This worm blasts entrancing bass-filled music, is under its spell. Tessa would like to be under its spell. She loves the four on the floor beat, the pulsating sound, the rhythm of the ground beneath her. Eat or dance indeed. Look at this delicious crawler, this delightful surprise, it wiggles its wormy body while the arpeggios echo out over the clearing, plump, full of juice, to the brim.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The trees were overfull. Daybreak broke without a nook for Tessa to rest within. She flew in circles losing track of where one loop ended and the next begun, crazed by the sunlight, by the sudden absence of dark, angry at Meredith, who pushed her out into the cool crisp morning without the shadow of the branches to mask her body beneath, to bask in the stillness.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How rarely she finds herself in the morning sun.&nbsp;How strange it is to land in a meadow. So much of her time she is hidden, still and ready to attack, ready to swoop up another nocturnal animal.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We,” the worm interrupts her in mid-thought, “are not long for the day.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tessa smirks.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I have a proposition,” slurs the worm.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Go on,” Tessa, lisps through her wet beak.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I would like to ask you… to dance with me.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tessa darts back, exposed. Could this wormy read her thoughts? Is it aware of her intentions?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It is the good stuff after all,” interrupts the worm again.&nbsp;“So go on and wiggle with me. We aren’t supposed to be here. We’re creatures of the night and the bars are all closed. Dance with me, you feathered, flying thing.”</p>

      <title>First They Stole Everything. Then They Burned Everything.</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2017/5/25/first-they-stole-everything-then-they-burned-everything</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They entered at night, like sneakers do. Sneaking peeks with flashlights under dark tee-shirts. The tees were wrapped around the lights, rubber banded to the shaft. The eager youngster clicked his on and off, totally blowing it already. They wore striped clothes like old prisoners. They thought it was a goof, though it looked like a prediction of conviction. They kept the brims of their wool hats down low, a bunch of eyebrow-covered bandits. The lead girl, whom they called the Chick, grunted and pointed, used baseball hand signals to communicate with the gang. The cement floor of the old warehouse was cold, they could feel it through their shoes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They didn’t expect the birthday party being held in the offices that overlooked the storage facility. They didn’t see the candlelights through the crossed beams of their moving flashlights. Being conspicuous wasn’t really something they were known for. The Chick said, “shhh” to the youngster several times to quell his overexcitement.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then came the cake.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The birthday party sang the birthday song as they watched the bandits from above. They watched them scurry across the wide cement floor, through the tall-shelved hallways, where pallets were raised and tucked during business hours by forklifts manned by remote control.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They sneaked the wrong peek,” says Brenda by the cake-candle light, to Gerald who has frosting in his moustache. They decided to keep the candles lit while they ate the cake.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“How do you mean?” asks Gerald, plucking the frosting from above his lip.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The place is meant to blow. Tonight. Remember?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Gerald had not remembered. He had not remembered that before the thieves broke into the warehouse that they themselves had planned to burn it. &nbsp;That in fact, the candles on the cake were part of the plan. The cake was being eaten to suggest that the candles had burned out. Yet the cake was the device, which Gerald has also forgotten. The device, Gerald trails off at the word. <em>What was the device in? </em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Chick finds the crate they are looking for.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’ll take two of us,” she says, grabbing one end of a large lid.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I got the other side,” whispers the youngster at full volume to everyone else.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They lift the lid, the smell of pine and bits of sawdust waft over them.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“There’s nothing in there.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A pop is heard from the place where the birthday party is.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What was that?” asks Brenda.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Sounded like the warning crack,” says Gerald.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Sounded like it was in the room,” replies Brenda.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Of course! It’s in the cake!” says Gerald, remembering. “Oh -”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The birthday party explodes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Aw, shit!” snaps the Chick. &nbsp;“Let’s move!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The sneaky peekers scurry across the cool floor to escape the escalating flames.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Though they robbed the place, and they did in fact burn the place to the ground, the office party did not escape the flames to reunite with their bounty. The cake was never meant to be enjoyed.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The Werstepheiners weren’t named after the bier, the bier was named after us!” This is what they say to begin their act, a simple defense of the family name before One decapitates Two. Two is always getting decapitated. This is not surprising to those that have seen the carnage. And all the limbs, as you may have read, grow back. So One decapitates Two and Half knocks over One and then snaps his suspenders against his bare chest with his thumbs.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They're named based on order of delivery, which contrary to popular opinion was not in the homeland, but in the heartland, just outside Gary, Indiana, amongst the trees, in a nutshell hideaway of a squirrel who’d forgotten his stash. Their very first trick was being born on the same day, not triplets, nor a twin amongst them, three cousins, each from a different wife of a sibling of the Werstepheiner name.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The routine never changes. People come back to the show to see the head back on the shoulders, to see the toes wiggle after they’re turned into little cocktail weenies. One loses all his piggies to an axe in the second act, while Two is still all arms out walking the stage in search of his head. The crowd likes to believe in being tricked, and wants more to believe they can solve the trick. The trick is: there is no trick.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“This is the genetic makeup of the trio doing the heavy lifting of regeneration” boasts their manager and introducer. “They become faceless every time they close their mouths and shut their eyes.” This is the act of caring about the act, not the Werstepheiners themselves. The audience cannot look away from them, the way a face emerges from the blank roundness of their head when they open their eyes.&nbsp;Yet folks look, as if the stage and the audience were separated by glass, as if they are safe. This is bloodsport, the oldest entertainment.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The axe trick is next. Headless Two finds the axe and seeks revenge on Half. He spins the blade out in a quickening motion. Then he chops a head off. Satisfied at the thump he feels he stops his spin cycle to gather the head in his arms. It has hair. It is One, not Half. Two shakes his arms to insinuate rage. Half dances in delight at the far end of the stage.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The act ends with all Werstepheiners pulling daggers from behind their backs. One and Two pin Half to a wall, both shoulders punctured by the blades. Then the curtain closes as they advance towards him, as if to say another head is coming off, you needn't worry, dear audience.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They are backstage in an all yellow dressing room. They request it this way, that the cabinets and the vanities, the chairs and the couches, all be painted the same bright color as the walls, that the fruit bowls be filled with lemons and bananas, and that the yellow candies be plucked from their packs and distributed in glass bowls: the lemon flavors, the banana taffies. They are sweaty, the show is done. Half cleans his knife as One and Two remove their elongated limbs.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You nearly got me,” muffles Two, whose head is tucked neatly in his chest. He unzips the costume’s panel to reveal the inner network of puppetry strings, cables, a featureless face. “Nearly got my <em>real</em> head.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Please,” says Half, counting the money thrown at them from the crowd. “I wasn’t close enough to break a hair.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They were onto us,” chimes in One, who has removed his toeless stilts, and is snipping the nails off his actual toes with a pair of yellow scissors.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Maybe you both have to tighten up,” says Half, eyebrows furrowed, “we’re light. Barely twenty apiece here.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Tighten up?” sneers Two, “Maybe you ought to direct us better, while we're out there looking for our heads!"</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The three cousins rise from their chairs, each in matching jumpers, each identical in size and shape, bald, faceless, half-men.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“How about we settle this with real knives!” says One.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You nearly hit <em>me</em> out there,” yelps Half. “So here’s your direction: I’m the Half that stays whole!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Half," says Two,&nbsp;"you’re the Werst. Epheiner!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They buckle over laughing, their faceless faces weeping from unseen seams.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You met me in a parking lot. I met you in a car wash. You saw me in an open shirt with an undershirt. I saw you in a seatbelt with your head back against the rest. You watched me smoke. I watched you smile. The cars came and went. The flapping tongues smacked the windows with their hot wax. I looked confident, you said. You looked happy, I told you. I shared my father’s name, my mother’s name. You said you’ve always lived alone. The boys aren’t coming back, is what I came to understand. Things will never be the same, I already knew. You opened the door for me leaning over from the passenger seat. The hot air blew wax and water in every direction, like it was fleeing. You buckled your belt and mentioned you’d been in an accident once. I placed my hand on your leg, forgetting I didn’t know you at all. Isn’t it meant to rain?&nbsp;you asked. It always is, I said. You forgot something so you run back into the store. I almost kissed you before the first man smacked a towel against the window. I couldn’t see you in the store, started to think you weren't coming back. You didn’t want to be in the car for this part, when the men scrub the thing down. You slid back into the passenger seat. The car rolled off the track. You lit my cigarette. The men asked us to get out, holding up vacuums. You didn’t move. Neither did I.</p>

      <title>The Vegetable Department</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2017/6/9/the-vegetable-department</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Sign here and here. Pick up your needles in the blue trays. Pick up your yarn in the green trays. You can talk to Tammy about the instructions, should any questions come up. Your example banana’s over there.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The woman telling you these things has never once leaned forward. She's in a relaxed pose deep in her chair. Her hair bun looks painful the way it pulls the shiny, product-heavy hair up towards the top of her round head. The bun pulls her eyes to the sides of her pin cushion face. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“After the first,” a smaller, thinner, mousy woman with oversized glasses says to you, while walking two steps ahead, “it's pretty streamlined. You'll be expected to produce more each day. In other words, it's imperative that you improve, that you perform.” She says this last bit under her breath, her eyes looking left and right.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can visualize the knitted banana from the commercial. You never expected to be here, never thought you'd be responsible for meeting the expectations of the makers of the knitted fruit products, never thought it would happen in this way.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“This yarn,” says a mole who you are positioned next to at a long table, atop a swivel stool, “is inedible.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh,” you think to yourself. You hadn’t thought of eating it, until now.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It makes you hungry,” says the mole. “I’m Gladys.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You shake Gladys's paw and look at her pile. She must be a top performer.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Gladys,” commands a voice from over your shoulder, “you’re behind you’re quota.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You look at Gladys, the moist end of her pink snout.&nbsp;Her nostrils flare as she breathes in, she quickens her pace.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You arrange your instruments:&nbsp;two needles, ball of yellow yarn, ball of green yarn, a grey tray of white cotton stuffing. You’ll start with green and transition to yellow. It’s a clean break in your mind.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You slip your knot and cast your first stitch. It feels like home, though this cement room isn’t very homely. You close your eyes, feel the sun hit your face from the skylights overhead. The windows are small, currently blocked by stacked pallets on tall shelving. You make a meadow in your mind. You knit a row. You knit two stitches. You combine them. Several more rows, several more stitches. You look down and you’ve transitioned to yellow. You didn’t even open your eyes. You stuff the shell. You make the shape. You knit a seam.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s a squash. Gladys is staring. Your shoulders tense. This is the fruit department. Surely they’ll have mercy. But you’ve heard stories. Solitary rooms. No visual aids. You’re sweating. Gladys is offering you a banana of her own. She’s still knitting, her small paws in a fury, nudging the thing with her shoulder towards you, not looking your way, whispering, “Take it. Take it. And get rid of that squash. You’ll get us all killed.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then you hear her throat clear from behind you and the big paws of an animal you don’t want to see the face of slide under your arms and lift you from your seat. You kick your feet, struggle to get one last look out, past the pallets and the shelves, to the outstretched lawn beyond the gates for one last glimpse of daylight. You yelp,&nbsp;"There are no windows there! Please!"</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My love was a gloved hand:&nbsp;my leather bedding. Then bat split me. They buried me in the dirt. Played the seventh inning stretch as they patted the mound. I could feel the water tap against the surface, trickle into my shallow grave. From this water, as I understand it now, I expanded into my current form. From the dirt I learned the ways seeds grow, the way roots reach around the soil, form a family with it. A root made its way to my grave and I dug myself out, stashed a few seeds in my mouth to keep them nourished, and from them buds sprouted. That’s how I’ve come to have these daisies, not that you care.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I watch the boy as he sleeps, his hand buried between his knees. I watch his back rise and fall with his breaths. I never had any use for air. My stitches contained everything. There’s pendants hanging around the room. There’s an image of me in the boy’s hand on his wall. I think that’s me, we all looked so alike. I used to think I’d be taken away with family when we went to the park, but somehow he located me, placed me back inside glove.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want blood, which is new. <em>Thirst</em>. I’d never experienced anything but <em>feel of grip</em> and <em>touch of air</em>. Breaking through air into mitt. I’m thirsty for blood I made against Mikey Showalter, the way his knee opened up and ended on me. I absorbed it then. Maybe that’s where I’m from?&nbsp;I’d like to know. I’d like to know what to do with these flowers. I wonder if he sees me down here.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I wonder where you are, too. I wonder if you're even sorry. I wonder if I'd mean anything to you now, looking this way, with these... appendages. I miss you. I hope I left a mark.</p>

      <title>Mr. Bricolage</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2017/7/5/mr-bricolage</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mr. Bricolage is making pancakes. His ladle has a leak. The thick paste drips over Bricolage's kitchen tiles, which alternate blue and white and now buttermilk too. Bricolage's spillings will make him late for work. Bricolage's mess will knock him to the ground. Bricolage's head will throb from the knot that is formed when he loses his footing. He will brush off the affair with a smile, thinking, <em>you clumsy Mister, you old pair of double lefts.&nbsp;</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mr. Bricolage's phone is unresponsive to his touch. He's missing minutes of a conference he's meant to be on. Bricolage spills soda on his keyboard whilst reaching for a twizzle stick. His computer ceases to work. Mr. Bricolage excuses himself for the rest of the day. He stands right up, walks right out. He smiles to himself thinking, <em>quite a doozy today, Bric, quite a show of hands.&nbsp;</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mr. Bricolage is turning the television on with one of many remote controls. He switches the channels to the proper configuration for his nightly game shows. There is no sound. He switches devices, he presses his thumb over buttons, he tries for an hour, his TV and his speakers never sync. "You devils," he whispers to his collection of remotes. "You little naughties."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He looks at the clock. He thinks about dessert. He rubs his burnt tongue over the back of his teeth, against the roof of his mouth. He decides that ice cream will not be on the menu tonight. He realizes he is quite tired. He knows tomorrow will be different. Mr. Bricolage looks around his apartment, turns off the light above the stove in his kitchen and says aloud to his plants, "tomorrow will be a better time to start today, my lovelies." He slides his palm against the wall as he traces so many nights' paths up the dark stairwell to the safe embrace of his thoroughly padded bedroom.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This man is holding a carrot. We ask that you disregard his rabbit mask. We ask that you pay little attention to those furry feet. Yes, he’s going to chomp that carrot, he’ll make quite a racket of the whole procedure. We’re anticipating the carrot shavings and spillings, the wet cubed crumbs, we’ve ordered the proper broomery to make a nice sweep of the room. He’ll do it all as if he were a true bunny. Look at him already acting like one, with that carrot eating grin.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Bunnies are a nuisance. It is known. Men dressed as bunnies - more so. We imagine this man in his palace, decorated in mostly gold, and otherwise marble. We imagine him practicing his hop along the shiny floors. We imagine the long hall of tall mirrors, him stopping to practice his bite in each reflective piece of glass, smiling wide, acting surprised and all that bunny stuff. He holds the carrot with his whole fist, holds the carrot between his thumb and forefinger daintily, holds the carrot within both hands, fingers touching, like he's in prayer, each scenario ending with the familiar snap, the gnash of orange crunching between his enamel.&nbsp;Then he gobbles the rest of the stick up quick. And then we send in the brooms.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Indoor bunny men are tricky to catch. Local eateries have placed them on endangered species lists. So we are no longer meant to snatch the bunnies in traps, not any more, not like we used to, not with the kind of carnage we’re thirsty for. We miss the blood soaked carcass. We miss peeling back the furs. We miss the meals. That's why we built this plaid holding facility, that's what we'd like you to pay attention to. They're out of the comfort of their gold, their marble, and they're here, with us.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Take for example this room. There is a single white plastic chair, a wooden table, a blue bowl with three oranges, six bananas, and one tennis ball within it. On the wall near the door is a sconce that we’re not crazy about but the Brick store was selling them for low prices and we couldn’t turn up the deal to have so many matching sconces for all of our many rooms. There is a heavy maple color from the table, it is what we call the foundation. Then there is the white from the plastic chair, we call this the complementary contrast. Then there are the splash colors: orange, yellow, neon green. The sconce emanates an amber glow from its frosted glass and gold case: this is what makes the plaid sparkle.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The bunny doesn’t see what is in the room. The objects are just lines crossing lines. It is our understanding that dots, circles, the colors we process to turn individual objects into separate entities are, when the animal is left unfed, turned to linear paths, a grid of lines, plaid patterns.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We’ve done many rooms this way. It’s how we trap the men dressed like bunnies. It’s where we feed them carrots. They cannot tell when the walls move. They never know it, until they’re being squeezed. We've sound proofed the rooms, of course, to not disturb the other bunnies.&nbsp;Then we make the soup.&nbsp;</p>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>This is an amazing fabrication that leads us, through detail (the sconces purchased at the Brick store) and references (peeling back the fur) to a wholly recognizable place, as odd as that sounds and unlikely as it seems. We feel ultimately familiar with both the rabbit-man's world AND the narrator's world.<br/>Fascinating!<br/>I came here because I just about Dan's award in Glimmer Train Bulletin #128. Congratulations, Dan!<br/>Can I ask how you decide when the story is finished?<br/>The title is particularly apt; it draws you in through sheer curiosity.</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

        <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[<p>EMG thanks for your kind words. We appreciate you worming with us! To answer your question, it always changes. Some stories are very clear and some wind around, some may still not be finished. A few of the pieces have continued in other forms elsewhere.<br/>This one was quite daunting to start because of the plaid and the strange disruption of perspective. But I found a pretty direct route to soup once it was underway. I think it was the way the bunny man was holding the carrot, how masculine his hands were, and then all that plaid had to be dealt with. I love this drawing, it was a really fun thing to respond to! Thanks again!</p>]]></wp:comment_content>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The goblins are hiding in the large head of the stone man on the hill top. The fish people are storming the waterside village. The owl faced babies have started chewing trees again. They are wasteful little angels, always using an entire tree to form a single spear, and they leave a bloody mess when they play war. The egg people are cracking,&nbsp;hatching the dragon dogs who are born ferocious. The old lady harbours her fruit in a satchel. She’s seen all this before. The goblins plot for too long in the stone head. They’re almost always speared by the owl faces. If they make it out the fish people eat them in two snaps.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When she was younger the old lady thought that the fish people had two pairs of legs, the one where their tails once were and a second set that grew from their mouths. Her own mother shot down this notion, grabbing her hand and marching to the parade grounds, which is what they called the place of constant war. She pointed out, directing the then much younger old lady's attention and said, “look there, don’t you recognize those shoes?” And this younger version of this old woman saw her father’s shoes, her father’s pants, leading all the way to the rope he knotted to hold his trousers up, his torso disappeared inside the wide open fish mouth covering the upper portion of his body. Where were the owl faces on that day? And why weren’t the dragon dogs setting the straw huts on fire and scaring the fishes back to the sea.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The dragon dogs are dummies, it turns out. The old woman came to understand this as she came to understand most things, at a very young age, this thing about youth and making a thing burn. These little yelpers cracked from their eggs and lit the world on fire. Before there was a tutelage they were ransacked by the goblins, chained to long sticks and forced in whatever direction their new masters demanded. The sticks were ridged against the necks of the dragon dogs, this was the world as they knew it - this is how the goblins possessed fire. This was their only way to cook the owl faced cherubim.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The owl faced babies have the advantage of flight, the old woman reminisced, smiling, picturing their terrible skills, while scrubbing the muck from a moat pillage. Flight and teeth like piranhas. She used to love watching them, drunk off holy water, clumsily fluttering their way into town. First, they’d send a scout, one lad who nary wore the mask, who left his soft baby face open to the elements. He’d whistle a soothing tune and deliver the message of peace: to begin he’d make a few beds for the townspeople, whistling all the while, producing the scent of freshly washed linens and lavender, next he’d twirl around, giggle if you poked his round little tummy, make himself at home among the townsfolk, always fluttering clumsily, his small wings carrying his fat baby body.&nbsp;Lastly, after a month or so, he would blow his tiny horn or strum his golden harp and in would swarm the flock, dressed in masks and war paint, baby warriors, little devil angels. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The mushrooms around the moat grow fiercest in the spring. The old lady was taught this, before her hair spun silver, before her hair grew rich and acorn brown, back when her hair was golden and sunkissed, when her small hand wrapped round her mother's finger. This was her secret, this is how she survived the forever massacres. Town after town would crumble in flames and fish people and owl faced cherubim. The goblins and their dragons. The owl faces and their spears. The fish people eating the townspeople, laying egg people who hatched even more dragon-dogs.</p>
</div>




















  
  





<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now, the old lady plants her crop in the moat. She cooks the harvest in a boiling cauldron, reduces it to a pulp, cooks the pulp down to an oil. In the evening of the first spring moon she visits the village wells, drips the oil into the drinking water. She goes to the river, drains the compost - what is left of the stems and seeds and pulp -&nbsp;into its bed. She ends the ritual wading far out into the ocean where she rinses the pot. The war always wages, ebbs and flows with the tides. She waits out the violence in the moat, where the fishes lay no eggs, and the goblins fear to tread. She makes her camp under the bridge, where the owl faces cannot see her, their torturer, their mother, the thing that quietly gives them purpose.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Trevor missed the call. He’s just realizing it now. What an idiot. Another boy his age, maybe Charles or McPeck, or Rhilo are going to do the pickup and delivery. He only put his phone down for a minute. He only placed it delicately on the glass so that he could go to the toilet. And then he masterbated, which he is now circling in his brain like a job he applied for and lost, like an add in the fine print after the funnies in the paper. He sees the word in bold type, all caps: JERKOFF, circled in red. The rest of the words around it are blurry.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He’s not there and some other guy is. And he has this stupid scar from scratching a zit that will probably always be on his cheek now. His red cheeks, all flushed from cumming, while sitting on the toilet. This summer is gonna be a drag. Especially if he puts his fucking phone down to go have a session. Especially if he misses her opening the door. Probably in some sheer white nightgown, probably with her golden hair blowing in the cross breeze from the open kitchen window, which is housed in shadows because all the lights are always off inside when she opens the door.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"Trevor, you fucker," says Trevor to Trevor in the hallway mirror. He stares at his dilated pupils. He thinks about packing another bowl. He thinks about quitting the fucking delivery game. He thinks he could meet her in the market all the same, just run into her amongst all the salamis and cheeses, just stumble upon her with his cart, look up, and make eye contact and say something cool like, "let’s go." And she takes his hand. And they walk out of the market together.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Not today though. She ordered in. He wants to call her by her first name, can hear her whispering his name in his ear. The thought of Rhilo rolling up to her house is driving him crazy. He just rolls up casual and gets out of his dad’s car and slides the pie to her and she asks him to come in and then she places her hand against the seam that runs over the zipper of his pants and she pulls him in like that, by his crotch, and she closes the door.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Trevor gets hard again thinking about it, thinking about Beverly, about Beverly Johnson, and he finds himself back in the bathroom and she’s whispering his name in his ear, and he’s cupping her boobs and he remembers not to call them boobs, never boobs, she’s older, <em>dummy</em>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He’s squeezing her breasts, Beverly Johnson’s breasts, and then he hears his phone vibrating against the glass in the foyer - he left it again - and his pants are in a ball on the shower rug to avoid a mess, and he’s saying, "no, no, no" as he finishes because he hears his mom pulling into the driveway and he very badly wants to get the fuck out of this crummy town already.</p>

      <title>Lormbtormb and Clagok</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2017/7/16/lormbtormb-and-clagok</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lormbtormb and Clagok are in a pinch. &nbsp;Their compatriots are in a twist. &nbsp;Every worm surrounding them have wrapped themselves around another worm. &nbsp;Well, except for Turglort, whose wrapped itself around itself. A triple knot, <em>what a blorging mess</em>. &nbsp;They’re on a rugby pitch, naked and exposed to the scorching sun, near the lake, where the dirt is the way they like it, cool and dark, a nice temperature for ample slumber when they are too drunk on rot to wiggle. But they got here too late, took a wrong turn, they surfaced in the night. Now the sun has announced itself.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They woke up like this: the sounds of a hundred worms screaming, like vampires left out to melt. They’re each subject to a hangover of their own making, each too lethargic to twist their way back beneath the surface, each looking up, at the blurry shadows of the flyers overhead, circling in wait to snip the lot of them off the pitch.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The screaming has nothing to do with the predators above, or the hangovers from within, it’s the pitch they find themselves on, <em>what a pinch</em>, the sun exposure, the lack of strength to burrow, the daylight is what invokes the screams. They’re used to a sort of permanent darkness, where their rich colors are lit by minute hanging globes in whatever bar they happen to be in. There aren’t so much homes in their world as corners dug out of paths that T off near bars. When the bars are overrun and the paths are too many there is a crumble, and the worms have to dig themselves out of the mess. This requires some level of sobriety, which can take weeks to achieve, or a much deeper drunkenness. Rot is pretty much the entire constitution of a worm.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Clagok vaguely remembers now, because the rum is gone, that the rum ran out. Cham-Cham started screaming about the campsite, about the bottles they could swim in, the apple cores, the soured grapes. They’d run out of what felt like an endless supply and the idea of facing life amongst one another sober was -&nbsp;sobering. They wiggled after Cham-Cham, to the songs of Volk, the apreggiatic maestro. The beats thumped and the worms made way through the dirt to the dark surface in the blackest hour of night.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But now it’s daytime. The screaming has taken on a rhythm itself. Sort of an Ah Ah Ah Ah four on the floor thing is happening, while some lower Oooooooooooohs drone through the empty space. There’s music to it, enough to zone out to. Lormbtormb is thinking of its beloved barstool, about the mad orgy it was in as bodies started wriggling away to the surface. Lormbtormb's tail was in another worm’s mouth, while Lormbtormb sucked rot from a scab on this other worm whose name Lormbtormb couldn’t pronounce and promptly forgot. The two of them had taken its stool, and Lormbtormb knew a quick release would get it back. Until now, it was a pretty subdued night by most standards, none amongst them would have catalogued such average details.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The sun hides behind a large cloud mass. Now they can only focus on the circling flyers, they can make out the talons, open and ready to snatch them in silhouette against the clouds. This is it. This is definitely it. They'll be flyer food. That's how the story will end. Here on this pitch.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then they hear the smack! This is followed by a booming voice from a biped above, a dense sound which they do not comprehend. And then they are soaked. And some of them wash clear off the pitch from the spill. The rest roll and tumble around, absorbing the wet with their bodies, furiously lap it up with their mouths.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lormbtormb sees the carnage: Chorble has split in two from the big falling thing, which contained all the drink. Lormbtormb looks at Chorble and tastes the drink that surrounds and covers the worms. <em>It’s rum!</em> Half of them already know. Lormbtormb laps it up. The biped swoops up its cup, leaves the broken glass,&nbsp;and walks into the water. The flyers circle. The worms get drunk enough to escape the talons. They wiggle and spit. Half of them end up in an orgy on the pitch. Lormbtormb and Clagok don’t allow themselves to get caught in the sex octet. They scramble and tumble, and find themselves back in the underneath, and the sounds of space disco are thumping. The bar is open. They're so very thirsty.</p>

      <title>Obstacles</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2017/7/24/obstacles</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Pens!” A collection of markers lean into one another in a navy plastic cube atop the desk. “Pens!” She wants to touch the pens. She has seen them and they are now what is on her mind. “Pens, a-ha!” She is pointing at the pens, waddling towards them pointing her tiny finger in their direction. She is thirty-two inches tall. She has been alive for nineteen months. There is a path on the floor that leads to the side of the desk where the cup that holds the pens sits. The cup is on the edge of the desk. She follows the path with her eyes, places one foot in front of the next.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh no.” It’s a business card. It is stuck to her foot. She lifts her foot and the card comes up with it, it’s glossy side adhering to her heal. She puts her foot back down. She lifts her foot, the card again lifts with it. She puts her foot back on the ground, somehow frees herself from the card, and steps backwards. This card has to be considered, laying in the middle of the already narrow path to the desk, to the cup on the desk, to the pens in the cup, "a-ha."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is only enough space between the soft grey box and the card on the floor for one of her feet. Opposite the grey cube is the teal plastic case that holds the machine. The card is near teal case, blocking half the path to the pens. She has to stay close to the soft grey box. She has to utilize a side step.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She moves in, with her butt facing the grey box, focuses on avoiding the sticky card on the floor, careful to get past the card. "Oh no!" She’s not facing the direction of the pens in the cup on the desk. She side steps right, again passing the card back to the open part of the room, erasing all progress to this point to reassess the situation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Pens!” She spots the pens, from her original vantage point, her purpose is revealed to her again. She pivots to her right wiggling her head between soft grey box and pesky business card on the floor. She side steps, side steps again, gets past the card and is facing them, reaches her arm to the top of the desk for some guidance, but her hand lands on a matchbox. It slides under her weight. She nearly loses her footing, she readjusts her wrist against the desk, stabilizes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“M-hmm.” She shakes the matchbook. She’s quite pleased with the light shaking noise that occurs with each shake. She shakes the box several times. She stares back to the room, giggling, pleased more with each shake. She turns back, as if she is turning the thought in her head with each shake, <em>what was it that I was - Pens!</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She lifts the matchbook high above her head and places it deeper on the desk than where she originally found it. She places her hand back on the desktop and again her hand slides over an object. It’s a folded receipt. The paper slides under her weight, she slides it off the desk and to the floor.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Uh-oh. Uh-oh.” She looks down at the paper, realizes this too is something she’ll need to avoid. She bends from her waist and sweeps at the thing, using her hand like a broom.&nbsp;“Haaaaa.” She again places her hand on the desk and steps her last step. She is now within reach of the pens. She reaches in and grabs one with her left hand. “Pen!” Then she looks at her right hand, realizing she is still holding zebra, that she has, in fact, been holding zebra during this whole quest. She must let go of zebra to grab more pens.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She places zebra’s head on the desk. His body pulls him off and to the floor. She picks zebra up from the floor and places zebra’s head on the desk. Zebra’s body pulls zebra back to the ground. This happens several more times. She abandons zebra, looking back to her original goal. She reaches into the cup and grabs a second pen.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Two pens! Haaaaa!” She looks from one pen to the next. She surveys them. Places one pen atop the soft grey cube and reaches for another pen. “Haaaaa!” She places the second and third pen on the soft grey cube. She reaches for another pen, then another. Then she puts both pens back. She looks to the soft grey cube and picks up the other recently discarded pens and places them back in the navy plastic cup atop the grey desk which sits along the white wall.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then she reaches for another object.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Wait, those are scissors!” She pauses and looks back at her daddy. She lowers her arms, picks up the business card, waddles over and hands it to him, clearing the path for next time.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dad’s mixing eggs in the blender again. Keeps staying up late at night watching the Rocky movie. He’s not working out though, he’s just taking the protein. I get shoved in a dumpster by the dumpster kids on my way to school. They take my snack money. I hide out for too long in there. It smells mostly like fish and fruit peels. Some oil gets on my grey sweatshirt. It sucks.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When the coast is clear I jump out. Never been in this alley before. Never seen this bookstore before. I duck in, just to be safe, bide myself some more time. Old geezer inside smells like moth balls. Like moth ball soup. He’s got glasses as thick as aquarium glass. I haven’t been in one of those in a long time. I miss ‘em, miss the way the fish swim to the glass and show me their bellies. I miss the sting rays, the darkness, the quiet.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Old man says, “help you with something?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I want to look at that one,” I tell him, pointing at the old book behind the glass.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Whaddayawanna look at that one fir?” he says.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I just wanna,” I practically scream.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Shouldn’t look at that one. Nothing but trouble - that one.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What’s the old geezer on about? Nothing but trouble? Just a book to me.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A cat jumps off a shelf behind a row of books and makes a big scream. Doesn’t even phase the geezer. Then sirens blast and he’s at the window, red and blue lights against his face.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I snatch the book from behind the glass. I’m no stealer usually. I’m a good kid. My dad drinks eggs. Makes me eggs, regular. We watch TV at night, mostly that Rocky movie. I don’t cause trouble. But I want the book so I snatch it up. I put it in my bag and before the geezer returns to me, I’m turning to him at the window.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Thanks for nothing, Mister,” I say.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You’ll be back,” says the geezer, but I seriously doubt it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I get to school and the dumpster kids are waiting for me. Waiting to shove me into a locker. Waiting to stain my sweet sweatshirt some more. I run. I run through the halls and up the stairs into an old crawlspace. I lose them. And then I’m alone. It’s just me. I remember my backpack and I look inside at the old geezer’s book. I slide the heavy thing out and open its dusty pages.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the beginning of the world, there was rocks and rock people, bats and bat people, big turtles, and horse riders. There is a baby princess who tells me her world’s dying. And she calls me by my name, which makes me pull away from this book real quick. What the heck? How’d she know my name? She says it again on the page, says to stay with her, to listen. So I keep reading on. She says there’s a big awful nothing that’s erasing her world. It’s gonna erase the rocks and the lakes and the fish and the rock people and the bats. There’s a snail rider too - he’s on the way out. They like to race one another, they say, they all can move real quick when they want to. I wouldn’t mind having a real fast snail myself, and I’m sad that these weirdos are gonna lose their world. So, I ask, “What can I do?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They say there’s a magnificent warrior named Tre-tre, they tell me he’s a horse rider. They say he’s ridden horses around the world. This kid and his horse, they say, are the savior and his beast, respectively. They say I gotta pay attention to this guy. The baby princess is all soft eyes at me and says, "please Bashti, just follow Tre-tre."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tre-tre and Or-ox are on the move. They’re questing for a mystic to tell them the big news about the nothing. It’s clear the darkness is spreading, lot’s of nothing creeping up in the place of lakes and dirt and rivers and forests. It’s a worldwide disappearing act here.&nbsp;Dad would say, “it’s like a goddamn magic show.” But dad’s not here.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m about to put the thing down because I’m feeling far too emotional about the things going down and the fact that the baby princess knows my name.&nbsp;Then Or-ox approaches a mountain and the mountain becomes a turtle. I can’t look away. This turtle creeps its big face and long neck out of its hillside shell and blinks long and hard at Tre-tre. It’s the freaking mystic. And the mystic has nothing to say. He sneezes on Tre-tre and Tre-tre gets angry. The turtle blinks long and hard, and seems ready to go back to sleep. But Tre-tre is persistent, he yells at the mystic, tells him he needs to know the next steps in the big plan. The turtle is like <em>fine, go into the mountains, and good luck twerp</em>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Immediately after this Tre-tre steers Or-ox into a sandpit. And like that, before I even got to know him, his horse gets stuck and then drowned. This is the saddest thing I’ve ever seen. Tre-tre cries and cries and yells out his buddy’s name, crawls into the pit to try and pull him out. He’s saying “Or-ox! Or-ox!” And the horse doesn’t budge. And then the sinking and the drowning. I cry and yell for Or-ox too and I feel like Tre-tre can hear me, but I’m still just sitting in this crawlspace being way too into this book.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Horseless Tre-tre begins to sink into the sadness near the turtle mountain. The world is ending. His horse is gone. His leather attire is cold in the cold and hot in the heat. There seems to be no wins. He is all misery now. Once he felt helpful and hopeful and true of heart. He is meant to be fighting in the name of the baby princess and the old ogres that used to walk these lands. He’s not much for the end of all things.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When Tre-tre is quite fed up he screams from the pit where he is now shoulder deep. He is tired of the shouting at the nothing, and the nothing creeping up on him, and all the bad things in the world creeping up on him at all times. He is tired of being horseless, he misses his beloved Or-ox. The world is not the same as it once was. And then, from the clouds bursts a beautiful white dog-faced dragon. He has scales and fur and shaggy ears and a calm soothing voice.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tre-tre reaches up and the oh so clean dog-faced dragon swoops him on his back and they travel high above the planet across all the nothing and everything. He takes him 9956 miles of his 10,000 mile journey. The dog-faced dragon laughs and laughs and reminds Tre-tre that after all this flying he still hasn’t asked his name. And Tre-tre says, what is your name? And old dog-face laughs again and says, “I’m Florecore!” Tre-tre laughs and laughs and says, "higher Florecore, higher!” They laugh until Tre-tre falls asleep.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He wakes up to the smells of home cooking. He’s in a net bed, in a warm room the shape of an acorn. A little booger of an elf is stirring worms into a stew. He’s smelling his worm soup and he’s all rosy cheeks and powdered sugar. He’s a pleasant looking little bugger. He snaps his suspenders and taps his plump little elf wife’s shoulder and whispers, “it’s almost ready” like it's the first worm soup he’s ever made.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tre-tre smiles at this, looking at the little fellow. He yawns and nearly knocks half the tiny house down. The clatter startles the elves who pop over to the giant amongst them.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“He’s awake!” &nbsp;yells the old elf man.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh my!” screams the lady of the house.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Are you elves?” asks Tre-tre.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Of course,” they reply folding their arms across their chests.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’ve never met an elf before,” says Tre-tre</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well, pleased to meet you,” says the old fella extending his hand.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And I am pleased to meet you, I’m Tre-tre, the warrior,” says Tre-tre.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’ve heard of a warrior by that name. But that man was paired with a horse,” says the elf man.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I had a horse. My horse is gone,” answers Tre-tre.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The warrior has an ancient relic across his chest,” says the elf man.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I wear this around my neck,”:says Tre-tre, revealing an amulet of ancient power and grace. On it two worms form a delicate knot and meet to form a perfect circle.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh! It is he!” yells the wife.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Quiet you,” yells the husband.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I will not,” yells the wife.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The wormulet is not proof!” shouts the elf man.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Wormulet?" asks Tre-tre, holding the amulet up.&nbsp;"Do you know what this means?"</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You don’t know what it means?” asks the old bugger.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’ve had it since I was a boy,” answers Tre-tre.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It is a source of great power," says the old elf.&nbsp;"It says you are the one that holds the power to stop it.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Stop what?” asks Tre-tre.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“He’s too young,” says the old elf man to his elf wife.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“He’s not so young,” says the elf woman.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“He doesn’t even know what it means,” says the elf man.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I can hear you,” says Tre-tre.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes, yes, perhaps a test,” says the elf man. “There are three tests that will prove if you are the one. Just being here means you've already passed two”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well, he has the wormulet,” interjects the elf man's elf wife.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Perhaps a bit of this worm soup first,” says the elf man.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The three of them fill the tiny home with slurps. The soup is a huge success. They slurp worms and steam rises from their black ceramic cups. The whole little hut smells of mushrooms and stock. They are filled with warmth and happiness. The warrior watches the people he’s meant to be saving bask in his presence, bursting with ancient joy. Of course he is the warrior.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The elf man shows Tre-tre his telescope, and the basket he has attached to strings to get to and from his viewing post. He tells Tre-tre that in order to prove his worth to the baby princess and the mystics, and the elflings, and even old dog-faced Florecore, that he must run past the twin quasars of rock, two laser eyed-stone demons in Athenian dress.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Dammit,” shouts Tre-tre. “That sounds really tough.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But everyone gives him a big hug, and he tells elf man, “get in that bucket, and don’t take your eyes off me because I’m definitely running past those Athenian dressed stoneys.” Everyone cheers Tre-tre and he just starts running like crazy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I find myself cheering too, in the crawlspace. It is well past dark. I think of dad, and how we could be watching the Rocky movie again, but like, that’s silly, and I bite into a big sandwich I forgot I stashed. Or maybe it wasn’t there at all. But in the book Tre-tre eats a sandwich too, even after all the worm soup, which is crazy, and also, while he's running. Cool, super freaking cool.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When Tre-tre reaches the stone goblins with the laser eyes, the twin quasars of rock, or whatever, he quickens his pace. The elf man is nearly breaking his basket as he hops up and down and shouts into his telescope. Florecore bites his lower lip and watches on too, barely able to handle the suspense.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And then Tre-tre reaches the stone men, and the goblins laser beam at Tre-tre and it looks like they're going to hit him! They miss him! They miss Tre-tre and instead they blow up their own selves. And now it seems there is nothing that Tre-tre can’t do. And he goes and finds the nothing, which is generally clouds and smoke, but appears to him now as a wolf.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This wolf dressed nothing is a big bad beasty. And Tre-tre rolls up his leather sleeves and says, "no way." And they fight. And it’s very dangerous, and there is much blood. But Tre-tre tells the nothing that he is nothing, and that nothing cannot even exist because even a nothing is something, and thus he negates himself by being, which is super deep.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tre-tre thinks of his wormulet, and he thinks of the worms in the soup and the worms eating the worms &nbsp;and making the circle. He looks at the nothing and says "A circle isn’t nothing." Then he says, "Or-ox wasn’t nothing!" Then he screams at the nothing and the nothing gets scared. Then the nothing explodes into a million pieces and it is so freaking sweet.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I can’t believe all I’ve read. It’s daylight now, and I’ve been in the crawlspace for a whole night reading about the most excellent adventures of Tre-tre. I climb out and school is just getting out, and from nowhere are the freaking dumpster kids. I start running and they’re totally chasing me to the dumpster. And then one says, “and I’ll take that book in your bag too.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And I stop in my tracks, and my hands turn to rock fists. “No way!” I scream.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I remove the book, and that’s when I notice it: the wormulet. It is on the cover of the book. I carefully remove it from the book’s hold and place it against my chest and out of the clear blue sky comes a white force. It’s Florecore, laughing as he zooms to the earth. He laughs and laughs. He lands at my feet and the dumpster kids have no idea what to make of it. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Bashti,” he yells and I climb atop the scaly dog-faced beast. We scare the dumpster kids into the dumpsters themselves. It is as if the world keeps high-fiving me. We soar into the sky and I can hear the grooving pulses of a rising chorus of synth rock all around us, the world is alive and new. We fly high above the world and even out of the country laughing all the while. I yell, “Florecore!” And Florecore yells, “Bashti!” And we freeze frame like angels against the day sky.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s too much. Think about your feet man, <em>dammit</em>. Remember when what’s-his-face said, <em>Dammit</em> that way? Think of what’s-his-face. Slumping in his chair. Hair a mess. Sort of pathetic. Not like you. Not like now. You are graceful. You are a gazelle. Where are those water stations? Do they have razors there? Is it a thing that some other runner has thought up. You should have trimmed it. You were gonna trim it. You keep licking your damned upper lip. Mile marker 18. Not even water.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Can you make it? Will you do it? Do it, man. <em>Dammit</em>. God, what a softy he was, with his round belly and always slightly untucked shirt - a mess of a guy and always smelling of whisky. Whisky. Soon, you can be whisked away.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She’ll be gone when you get home, <em>dummy</em>. Lick the stash, tastes like sweat. Is she there? Is she on you? Was that yesterday? No. Two weeks. <em>Past</em> two weeks. You and your <em>training</em>. You and your <em>quick feet</em>. She was gone when you got back. Said she’d leave if you left. Made her points plain. You’re hitting with your heel again. Toes first. Pounce more. Bounce. Lengthen the stride. Focus on the footing. One-two. Two-two. Don’t count off. You get lost in it. Mile 4 was a thousand numbers. It’s dizzying. They mount up. Counting off the miles in quarters. Looking for the road signs. Checking out the lawn chairs and the beers in hands and the many faced onlookers. They’re screaming for you. Is <em>she</em> out there? Can Cheryl hear you?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ll take a trip out to the ranch. I’ll tell her in advance. I’ll call her and bellyache and say this was it, the final race. It’s no first place today. 3, 14, and 22 have been in front of me the whole time. That’s 39. I want to cut them each into 13s and take them by surprise. Three 13s is easier than 39. I can work with 13s. I just have to double myself, a simple multiplication of two. I only need to cut one to show. Match 14 and pass him. I’m breathing too hard. No more numbers. Back to toes. Chest out. You have this.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She had you. You can see the small of her back when she bends off the bed. For what? A sock? A stocking? Is she sliding back into what she left at the bedside? Is it time for her to go already? She was always out the door on your <em>off</em> days. And you were always long gone when she wanted to stay.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You are a runner. You’ve always ran. She touched your back that last night and you winced. Felt her hand retreat without seeing it. Wanted to take the wince back. <em>Un</em>-tense the shoulders. The air around you moved. Then the air in the room was still. Still smelled like her. Vanilla body oil and some flower you never remember the name of. Citrus. A citrus-like scent. You listened for her breathing. Is she out here?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mile 24. She wanted me to trim it. Wanted me to lose it. Said she missed me clean. Four quarters left. Was it too much to ask? Could I have been that insulted? I told her to stop riding me. I told her to not ride me so hard. Don't cramp me. Don’t tread. She left her treads. I’m all marked up. I’m gonna chop this sweaty fucker off.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Three quarters left. What’s the matter with Kate Bush anyway? It’s just something she thought we should try. Just music. Just a needle on another record. I shut it down. I’m a lowlife. I’m a crimelord. I’m down in the gutter. Oh shit, that’s 14.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Two quarters left. Where do you go from here?&nbsp;You can see the three of them. They’re paces in front of you. You’ll pass 14. That’s one 13. Only 3 will be left. You can put 3 in his rightful place. 22 is way out. You’ll never reach him. But you can be 2. You can be 2. You see it in your head as you pass 14 and enter the final quarter. You see the number 2. You can be 2. You can be 2. You can be. You see you. You can be too. You see her. You can be two. You could have been two.</p>

      <title>Old Tony: UPSTATE</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2017/8/12/old-tony</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Old Tony wipes his arm across his upper lip. He’s been shifting pies with his peel, deep in the oven. Vassar ordered 400 pies. It’s taken him all day to prep it. What's he gonna say, "no?" Now the cooking is on, and the phone’s still ringing, because his pies are the best. His white tee has dough past the apron, on the shoulders. This is his third apron today, the other two are curled into balls in the linen basket he keeps in the corner. He tosses a linen rag over the round bald top of his head and pats it a few times. Then he brings the rag over the ring of hair around his ears and down to wipe his neck. “Whataya gonnado.” he says to an audience of silver bowls,&nbsp;resting his hands against his hips, smiling slyly.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He makes the dough in the morning, usually about 200 rounds worth. The dough is portioned out and placed into the stackable bowls. The kids who know best order small pies for thicker crust because Old Tony never changes the portion. He marvels at the stack. He’s had to double it. It looks like he’s not going to have room to dress the pies, or maybe the stacks will topple over and crush the whole operation and him with it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All Old Tony’s kids are always running around. The place is a dump, it’s not well lit, the tables and chairs are old. It probably seats twenty people tops, and Old Tony’s wife sits at one of the tables with her kids or grandkids almost all the time while he flips the dough and peels the pies. Midway through the cook he’ll remove a pie and add more cheese, an extra few sliced sausages and then re-fire it.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The neighborhood kids argue over whether Old Tony’s place is the best. The arguments against it have more to do with decor and lighting than the quality of the pie. They don’t get that it’s just him in there, even when the place is full. Even for 400 pizzas. He picks up the phone, and does his little dance, and sprinkles every cheese and ladles every spoonful of that bright red sauce. He’s a master. Even the gorilla painted on the window atop the empire state building is holding one of Old Tony’s slices.&nbsp;What brought Old Tony to Poughkeepsie? Nobody’ll ever know.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Middle aged Tony took this one kid's checks. For years he did this. The kid showed up, smiled and said, "Hey Tony, you take check?" "For you," Tony said, before he was old and his ring of hair was all grey, "sure."&nbsp;And Tony kept taking this kid's dad's checks for so long he learned the kid's dad's name. "Hey Mike," he always said, "howydoin?" The kid smiled and said,&nbsp;"pretty good." He'd keep saying this for years, answering to his dad's name as they both got older. They'd have tiny conversations over the years, Tony always looking up and saying, "Hey Mike, howydoin?" And this kid, whose name old Tony never knew, who wrote him five and six dollar checks for his delicious pizza for years, never had the heart to give him his real name, he liked that Old Tony had taken the time to learn a name at all, even if it wasn't his, even if it was his dad's, from all those checks that often went uncashed.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Remember the rules?&nbsp;These are the rules. You bundle up as many full bags of garbage -”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And they can be full of anything?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And they can be full of anything. So do what you think but, light weight is better, because really -</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Really wanna go fast.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And the volume -”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Volume’s gotta be big. So lot’s of bags”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s it. So real light weight is my suggestion”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s a race. A classic Clobbersmith invention.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We’ll race straight down Coney Island Avenue.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They’ll race straight down Coney Island Avenue.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And right down the center of the street.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Right down the center. They’ll take a sharp left at the end of the street near Avenue Z and then they’ll come back up.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And you wanna skim the cars.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Skimming the cars is very important in the race, to accrue points. They round up as many garbage bags as they can fit in either hand (as much as either hand can hold). They reach them far out and try to skim the passing cars. The cars, it should be known, don’t know anything about the Clobbersmith’s race. They are just driving on a city street in the County of Kings.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The hard part is the one-shoe-on one-shoe-off part.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The not wearing both shoes part”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The only wearing one shoes part!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They’ll run with one shoe on and one shoe off, down the center of the street, carrying as many bags as possible in either hand, the goal being that the bags add to their volume and their volume stretches, in an ideal scenario for a best case race, far and wide in order to skim as many passing vehicles that are unaware as possible.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It can be for <em>your</em> self.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You can race your own best time.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Your own <em>self</em> best.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And the number of bags is important.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It has to be as many as you can carry.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We test that before hand.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Of course we carry as many as we can carry. We all want to win against our own best selves too.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They make the turn at Avenue Z and head all the way back up to Avenue C where the race startred.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And shopping carts are fair game.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Shopping carts, abandoned on the street, are allowed, by the rules, to be utilized during the race. The carts make it possible to up their bag count, which in turn, if rigged correctly, can also increase the overall volume of the racer - a bag pile mushrooming over the top of the cart pushing out far past the sides and skimming so many more cars at once.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“A top of the car skim from a loose cart is double points.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The mushroom bag pile on top of cart technique can be a stupendous point earner.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Who tracks the points?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We all track the points.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh yeah!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But what if we aren’t near the other.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s what the knives are for.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Trust!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yup”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Trust knives!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Trust knives were brought in to the race after a discrepancy in a point tally after the first contest. Each Clobbersmith now carries a trust knife in order to pair off with another Clobbersmith should a point discrepancy arise.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It makes you trust the other ‘Smith because he’s got the knife.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s a self respect thing.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I can trust him, cause I know I have a knife.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Me too.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After they make the turn, after a grueling run, they make their way back to Avenue C, all the way from Z, to where the race began. They run up three stories, all the bags still in hand, to the roof deck of their apartment building and they burst open the roof door.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And that’s when the bags are launched.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s my favorite part!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"That’s when we throw the bags.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To end the race, and confirm a final tally of the bags, each Smith tosses each bag over the roof, back into the traffic they spent the last several hours skimming, counting off the numbers as they fly them over the side.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Can’t drop a bag to throw a bag.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In order to end the race successfully each bag must be individually tossed, one by one, over the roof, without dropping or losing another bag, a task that gets easier as the bag count per hand drops.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But the first few are hard.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“First few hurt, ‘cause the plastic’s already been wrapped ‘round all the fingers.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The bags hurt after all the skims and the furious pace of the race."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And then at long last when the race is complete they tally the points -</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s far too dark already to race today"</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"On account of explaining the rules.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well, we have to go over the rules.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah, lotta times we don’t race on account of checking the rules.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They don’t ever talk about what happens after the bags are thrown, about the tallies and the scream matches. They fill a tub to the brim with cold beer, ice, and salt, and for every bag thrown they drink a beer before the tallying begins. But they don't talk about the counting of bags, or the beers in the tub. They just sharpen their trust knives and await the race to come.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last night out. Old Tony bends his legs as he empties the dredge. The shells ting against the crosshatched metal deck buried in mud and rocks. The metal links shake, drip the rest of the water. Scallops will have to be shucked immediately and thrown on the ice. Not easy work. Old Tony does the math quickly in his head. Easily five hundred pounds less than last week at this time. He’s not gonna make it to September without some real pinching. They’ve reduced his days out here, he’s got to stay in regulation. All he’s got is Glenn and Robbie. Let the other two go to another boat in need of hands. He grumbles audibly.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Not a lot is it?” Glenn says.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Tis not,” he says back, thinking antiquated language will lighten his mood. He stares at the lanky girl before him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’ll start shuck -</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Old Tony raises his hand. “You gather, I’ll shuck. Where’s Robbie?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Glenn motions to the boy, lit blue by the screen of his phone, looking at pictures of the girl on the shore that’s left his heart an open wound. He’s been a sad sack the last month.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Robbie!” Old Tony shouts. The boy darts to his feet. Wipes his nose. He’s been crying again. Old Tony shakes his head and remembers his calm. “S’ok boy. Grab your knife.” The boy sits and shucks. “What’re you twenty-two?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Twenty-three.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Twenty-three? One got past me, did it?” Old Tony looks out at the black water. “Fair enough.” The cloudy sky masks the moon and casts a hazy glow over the sea. “What do you say we turn off these flood lights?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Glenn looks up, bent over the mud, arms buried in thick rubber gloves.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“S’alright Glenn, we’ll leave a light on, just lose the floods.” The girl hustles to the control panel and pulls the lights. “Cut the engine too, girl!” The boat goes quiet.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Glenn makes her way back to culling. Old Tony bends a knee and culls too.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What’re you Glenn,” Old Tony whispers, “nineteen?” Glenn nods, used to the old man’s prodding. He knows damn well how old she is. “The two of you,” he says louder, “out here 89 days, now the season's tallied,&nbsp;and hardly looked at each other.” Glenn bows her head. “S’ok Glenn,” whispers Old Tony, “you’re just gonna have to be in charge of asking for his number. He’s too blind to see what’s in front of him.” The old buzzard winks at the girl and they sift through the sludge quietly in the dark. The boy shucks, a familiar and satisfying rhythm overtakes the boat. The water laps against the hull. White clouds puff from the mouths of the fisherman and his young crew.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They met at a party. Already drinking when they crossed paths. He was nervous to lose her when he excused himself to use the bathroom. He returned to her in the same place, waiting. He’d only worn a suit a few times before this, was nervous about his appearance until she threw her head back when she laughed the way that she did.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She liked bikes and had brothers and a mom and a dad. His family was mostly gone and his hands were like her father’s – calloused, strong, lived in. She couldn’t remember where she’d seen him first but it was somewhere in town. He said he would have remembered having seen her. Hours later they stood close in a quiet room, away from the other guests, and talked in whispers, and shared a very polite first kiss. They sat close on a small couch and talked about seeing the world. He saw it from a truck, or behind a tool. She dreamed of boats. He forgot about being tough. She forgot about being cautious. They left together. She was forward. He was shy. He made breakfast in the morning and she stuck around for it. They ate. Quiet, comfortable.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She left him her number. He’d taken work on a farm several counties away. He told her only that he’d be gone a while, and that he’d like to see her upon his return. He got back, placed a bag of fresh vegetables on the table, slid his fingertip beneath the tab of a beer can and picked up the phone from the line in the kitchen. Her number was on the napkin where she’d left it, prominently displayed over a calendar reading the wrong month – its squares filled with doodles but no appointments. She picked up after a ring, attempted indifference to his call, and eventually let out a long laugh at something he said, and he relaxed into asking. She agreed that a picnic in the field would be nice.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Over a six-pack under a tree they blew dandelion seeds and walked the paths they were mapping for themselves, filling in the gaps of what’s already been done. He talked about the tree they were beneath, about climbing it when he was young. She talked about her brothers and the early lessons of knowing how to get what you want in a house of boys. She wore a sweater around her neck, as she had at the party. She reminded him of Rita Hayworth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He went to see a movie once with his dad. Rita Hayworth popped onto the screen and he could hear, in that moment, an absence of breath in the theatre, between he and his father. The room stopped breathing. He looked at his dad that day, at his raised eyebrows, at a man who was once a boy like him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the grass under the tree she asked him,&nbsp;“what would you do if I didn’t have eyes?” He barely paused before answering, “I’d hold your hand when you asked for it.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And if I didn’t want you to guide me?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well, I suppose I would let go, but I’d let my facilities be known.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Your facilities?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’d let you know I’d be there, should you need me.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s very kind.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You worried about your eyes?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’m worried about every single thing.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And if I told you there’s no need to worry.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Then I’d tell you you’re not paying close enough attention.” She smiled having said this, her eyes drifting past him and out again, across the meadow. He watched her smile fade, clouds rolled in from the distance.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then she said what he is remembering now, in his empty home: “if I ever leave you, I’ll take everything.” He held his breath there in the meadow when she said it, her eyebrows raised high and her head tilted down so she was looking up at him. He believed her but he couldn’t escape the feeling he had when he first saw Rita Hayworth. She let out a long laugh after and they made love in a thunderstorm.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And now, on the center of their kitchen floor, at the cross section of four tiles sits this onion. Not a note, just the root vegetable with the glossy white heart in its center. He picks it up. He buries it in the dirt.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">King Horian, the brief, they called him the butterscotch king, he liked things sweet. The sasquatch king. The sassafras ruler. King Slurp, the usurper. The lisp and the stutter, the gumdrop leader, the king of toes, the king of kink, the slinky king. He took away the church. He locked away the key. Sexual decries every day for weeks. He fed the bibles to birds, they pecked away every piece. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He liked a light spank and a tight knot. He ordered replacements for Jesters, summoned the sexworkers from the brothels, placed them on the palace tiles, they were no longer to be reviled. He wrapped them in the finest leather, he filled the place with fondles. The seamstresses sewed an army of unnecessary zippers across the fresh cowhide. His people were encouraged to be taken as pets, to wear ball gags to court, to watch him laugh at all the sex acts. He rinsed butts with whipped cream. The spank and the clatter. He took his breakfast among the bodies.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Our bodiesh are equal,” he lisped to the court, “sho, take and give an equal share!” He filled his chambers with tits and cock, replaced the bed sheets with bodies. The forever orgy for the living things.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Horian twisted his waxy beard in his calloused fingers as he watched, liked to make demands as much as he kept quiet. He’d hide behind a bush, he'd clench his teeth with a twig. He chopped wood in the nude wearing only his crown, out on the palace grounds, a wide stride in his gate, with his balls pronounced. He was noticeably erect at dinner. He ordered long, deep tables to be built so that guests could be serviced as they ate. He tucked every thirsty little sub underneath the cloths, they helped all the visitors off their rocks.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He freed those who stayed, freed them from chains. Of course those who stayed were likely to wear the willing chain. Horian, the pleasure seeker, had grand thoughts for his people, his small kingdom, he let be known, was only for the fully grown, for men and women unafraid to show their true selves in the light of day. No indulgence was to be hidden, outed was every kink, only secrecy forbidden.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The puritans fled the city gates, covered their children’s eyes and ears as they ran for someplace safe. Grown men walked on all fours, led by leashes carried by women once labeled whore. Now these ladies were mighty and bold and held to high esteem in court. After all, the King decried, that women come first, by any means.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Foreigners paid their visits to affirm their disbelief, every little tight lip afraid to give a quiver. They looked at him with clenched jaws, he looked at them like trained little pigs. "Appalled by the madnessh," muttered the king to himself, "afraid of their own shadness."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“My meshods,” he said to a visiting king, caressing the head of a man kneeling at his side, beneath a sheet, “are very shimilar to your own, don’t you shee?" After a loud gaffaw, this visitor, held his triangular nose to the ceiling, a sign of great disrespect, from his old world.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">King Horian grew softer in his speech. "You shubmit to your god. I shubmit to the show. The show of handsh, of body partsh and underpantsh. Now, if you’ll excushe me, I’ve left shome looshe ends I musht go tie.” The king tilted his head back and laughed with a high cackle. He stood, guzzled his goblet of wine, sloppily slurped as it stained his robe. A red trail trickled down his chest, then he smiled, and said, “you’d be amazhed at what an ashhole can do.” He dropped his robe, and exited the room. A fatal mistake. A miscalculated moon.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The triangle king bared a cross affixed to his chest. He watched the mad king’s ass sway away from him in the lewd crude manor it’d been so accurately described. This nasty thing, this crude misuse of the body. Horian was to be made an example of.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Within weeks, while his kingdom of kink and savage pleasure was a single body intertwined, the triangle's forces from the east took the castle. Horian, the king of beasts, was found suckling on a woman’s feet. His lisped words slinked out past the toes beneath his teeth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“This man is to be set in stone, why not start with just his feet.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And like that the pleasure king was seized. They buried his feet in cement and made a public decry. Any citizen to show skin would be met with the wrath of their new king. They locked up anyone on the grounds that was nude for a lifetime of darkness and solitude.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The citizens of fuckery found pleasure in the darkness. They tormented the guards with their infinite orgies. Yet, the prisons were open rooms, and the filth stacked up, caused death and disease, the kingdom’s spirit broke, fell to its knees.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Outside, in the sunshine, laid the old king left to die. For weeks on end he was tortured, made to stand. The triangle king could not force the smile from the ungodly king’s face, so thrilled by the whip was he while standing in place. They salted his wounds and bound him to the ground, his feet mounted firmly, his knees bent to aching.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then they left him there, alone, naked. His skin burned, his body caved, his once robust figure shrank day by day. With every rainfall he extended his lease. And then a drought in the land, and Graveltoes could see his defeat. The hazy clouds passed above him and he pictured all the delicious body parts in the formations. Light headed, near the end, footsteps in the distance. A hooded figure approached him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He didn’t recognize the servant at first, covered by hood, and fully clothed. When she revealed her face he saw the sad kindness of one he used to keep in voluntary chains. He looked to her with weary eyes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Sho thirshty,” he gasped in words that felt like sand against his throat.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I have no water,” she whispered, “<em>my</em> king.” His eyes welled at the mention of the word.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Am I,” he whispered, “shtill... <em>your</em> king?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Forever you will be my king.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It will be the end of me, this thirsht.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“My king, you can drink… from me.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A rush flooded over him as she opened her legs, the man who’d thought of every depravity. He laid beneath her, a smile across his face. “Tell the rest,” he said to his savior. “Tell them their king is free.”</p>

      <title>This Young Dad</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2017/10/8/this-young-dad</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This young dad. This young dad in the room. This young dude with the lights out. Dancing alone, of his own volition. He has his headphones on. His wife asleep. His daughter asleep. He sways in the dark. His thumb scrolls the screen in his hand. His eyes glossed over. His lips stained purple from the Montepulciano. He mouths the word <em>Montepulciano</em> as he pours a glass to its brim. “Last glass in bud,” he cheers’ himself. “Last dance wins.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He opens email on his phone. His face lit blue for all to see in the windows outside this ground level living room. He’s in a real bungalow: A California King. His robe is open freely. He has a captain’s hat atop his head. Hasn’t taken it off since France.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>I know we're not all there together and we haven't talked about this too much, but are we all happy about this new record by this old band? Are we all sort of swaying together in our separate living rooms? If not just maybe don't say anything.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He sends the message, feels it slipping away. He turns the volume up and does a big spin on his heels against the hardwood. Puts his phone in his pocket and sways. He laughs out loud as takes a big sip from the too full glass. “Stemless Susan,” he whispers to the glass. “A glass with no legs… shame, shame, I know -” The young dad picks his phone up, slides his thumb over the buttons.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>I just think that, the older we get, it's easy to think of things like the time we shared together as a nice one off, like a trip to disney land or the year your team won it all, but we should remember that it was more than that.&nbsp;We were dads. In france. And also a groom, who was not a dad, but in France. </em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This young dad sends the second message, puts the phone down again. Oh baby, he thinks. He cradles the wine glass in his palm, old Susan, old Stemless. The synths rise. He wants it to last. Wants the dance to dance itself skyward. Age and time and getting older and what happened and what’s next and how now.&nbsp;He slides his phone out once more.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>luv u bois is all</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The light turns on. He presses his thumb over an arrow.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Honey,” says his wife in her nightgown, leaning like she's been there for ages, hand on her hip. He looks up at her, rests his hand over his exposed belly, his open robe.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh babe. You gotta hear this.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Do you want to put it on the speakers?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“<em>Yes!</em> I really do.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Ok.” He swipes the phone to airplay, sending a signal to the receiver which broadcast from the monitors on the bookshelves.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Would you like to dance with me?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Ok. I am quite sleepy though.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“So, just take one step forward.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Is that good?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s great, babe. We’ll have to play this louder tomorrow.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Ok love.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They flick the light off, make a paired silhouette through their bungalow window. This young dad with this young mom's hand in his hand. Thinking tomorrow we can play it louder. Even louder than we did today. We’ll open the windows. We’ll let the light in. We'll all sway.</p>

      <title>The Ottawalla Peninsula Naming Committee</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2017/10/12/grandmothers-in-wait</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The peninsula women sit on rockers at the party. Sally Mayfield is turning seventy-two. She’s rented the clubhouse, she’s invited Tapper &amp; Kip to the party. Sally has been here the longest, seen the largest storms, raises the highest voice in protest to those that move in, to those that mean to hurt, to those that forget the histories, to those that hoist guns in the direction of ducks, to those that staple shingles to houses on weekends. She is a loud woman, destined to be a grandmother with or without the consent of the rest.&nbsp;These women have survived their spouses, children, the sons of the seashore have moved on, moved inland, left the water for higher ground. And last week, suddenly, an announcement of twin boys. The community wants to raise them well, to ignore the histories, to lift them up.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The circle of septuagenarians pierce their stitches and pull their needles through. Blankets in various states of creation drape over each set of legs. Velma is nearly finished a king sized quilt which slinks out of a large canvas bag. Eensie, a woman once called Eleanor far before any of these women knew her, is starting the second in a new pair of baby boots. With her frame and her delicate hands the first boot looks like it’ll fit her.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They’re for the twins,” Eensie mouths under her breath to Clarise, a woman best described as an antelope, tall graceful neck, earrings like antlers branching from her lobes. Clarice nods and darts a small needle through a tambourine shaped canvas. She needlepoints signs with words on them (“Extraordinary ladies hardly got anywhere being ordinary”) that hang in kitchens around town. They conduct energy through the stitching of their needles through yarn, they spin tales of the twins, of the future kings of the small peninsula.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But who needs kings? Who even said anything about kings?” says Sally. “The boys will be whatever we raise them to be.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What do you think the mothers should call them?” asks Lydia. Kip &amp; Tapper, the expecting mothers look at one another, wondering why they’re not being asked directly.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well we should have a naming committee,” responds Sally.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Indeed,” chimes Rose Abernackle, “I used to love a good naming committee.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’m unfamiliar with -” Kip is abruptly cut off from the grandmothers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Before your time dear,” says Lydia.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh we should tell them,” says Velma.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Of course they should participate,” says Rose.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Of course the choice is ultimately theirs,” says Sally with a knowing smirk.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But the committee, should run its course,” says Rose.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Have to let the committee reach a conclusion,” says Velma.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Really must have a good show of hands at a community meeting,” says Lydia.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Indeed,” says Sally.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The young mothers look at one another as if they’re chewing each remaining bit of nail and cuticle left. The clipboard is passed. A piece of paper is written on by each woman, torn off the board, folded, placed in an old ball cap that follows the board. There is little pause as each woman scribbles. They put their names in the cap. Sally plucks the folded pieces of paper. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Are you going to read them aloud?” asks Kip.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We tally them,” answers Sally. “The names with the most votes are announced.” &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“This was very nice,” says Kip. “We really do enjoy the... support.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Richard Richard,” interrupts Tapper. “They’ll both be called Richard Richard.” The old women cannot hide their shock. Sally winces, pretends not to notice, continues the tally on the far side of the room. Tapper announces louder, “Couple of little Rich Dicks, our little Richie Riches.” “Those can’t be the names,” whispers Eensie to Clarice who tucks her chin all the way into her neck in disbelief.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Those will be the names,” shouts Kip, who is very pregnant in this moment with these two boys in her belly. “We’re going to give them the world. They’re going to turn this place into a storage facility. And they already have four grandmothers, you old bats!” She waddles past the sewing circle and out of the room. Tapper gathers their bags and quietly leaves in chase.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One by one a needle and yarn is picked back up and the quiet clicking consumes the room.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“My, what a show,” says Eensie.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I remember those days,” says Rose.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“My Annabelle, I was as big as a house,” says Velma.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Youth is wasted,” says Clarice.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“On the youth!” shouts the circle, erupting in a cackle.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Storage units.” laughs Lydia. “All houses become storage units. That's parenthood.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sally, stares over the grid of unfolded papers on the foldout table in her makeshift office in the wide-open clubhouse room. She writes the final tally.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Eight Baracks,” Sally proudly announces. “And seven Olivers.” She looks at the women, all pleased as punch with their lap fulls of soft material. “Which of our little boys will come first?”</p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">4</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Maurice is in a sweat. It started with a dropped call and was followed by a missed text, in a hurry, soaking wet. This is why he prefers the water. He’s a sweater. He’s not a <em>noun</em> sweater, he’s a <em>verb</em> sweater. He’s an action item. And everything’s different underwater. He jellyfishes his way around a thing, elegant and graceful, happy, quadrapus. This soaking wet from soaking sweat is drying him out. The drying out begets more wet from sweat. The sweat, the sweat, the missed text, the late to the party scramble, the showing up out of breath. The "Maurice, let’s go!" from Torgle. Forging Torgle, Maurice is thinking, <em>forging Torgle</em> and<em> blorging sweat</em>. <em>Torgle needs a forging reset</em>. I’m so thirsty and she didn’t work in a drink holder for me, and I’m left with the salt from my, <em>Maurice’s,</em> upper lip.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">2</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">0000000000000000CERTAIN_SETTING_REFINEMENT_I_WANT_ALL_OF_YOUR_MIND_111111000000000111111111_PEDDLE_SETTING_REPROGRAM_LEG_ACTION____________LOVE_ACTION_00000000111100001101000010100110100000_THUGGING_CHUMPING_CHUGGING_SORTING_OIL_REFILL_IN0003_IN002_IN001_REFILL_REFILL_REFUEL_SO_COOL_WHAT#S_A_NEW_OS_WHO_NEEDS_A_NEW_OS_YOU_NEED_A_NEW_OS_DUMMY_HA_HA_HA_HA_HA_HA_RESUME_PEDDLE_UPHILL_010101010101000001111100001010100000000000000_WHAT’S_THE_LITTLE_ONE#S_NAME_AGAIN?????</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">3</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How and whys? How and whys am I here, in the middle. The pickle, that’s what I call the middle. Hows and whys? What are the hows. First hows is Suzie’s house. Suzie’s house on time. Before on time. And they’re already at it. I should have could have left. I could have should have left. And now what? The whys are always the same. Why she smells the way she smells. The showing up early. The calendars synced across all devices. And the peddling. I’m fun, I just can’t drink and do this. It can’t be a party cruise, somebody’s gotta be somebody some of the time. Just to be in the room with her. To be on the bike with her. To be a Maurice away from her. Our cubicles are so far across the room. Just the this. This close. Can smell her vanilla shampoo, even beyond the vodka lemonades. Even beyond the vodka prominade. But that Buster is gonna crash us. This bike and that’ll be the real hows. The real hows will be the house at the end of the long hill down.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">1</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Drinking rum having fun in the sun on the run. Rum tum tum. Rub tug tug. Suzie likes the package of a vodka and a savage. They like to joke. Oh I’m that savage. I’d like to give them a run of me on ravage. <em>Rampage version 2.0. I eat the wolf. I ride the lizard, we bake blondie’s in the window with fire breath</em>. Nah, I wear the spin cap and laugh and laugh just to prove I’m not the sav. I’m ultra fun. I’m reliably affable. A tangle bit of tangible. The jungle animal. Use the feet to make the drinks, make them sweet with those silly feet. Lime in the coconut. Coconut in the lime. I’ll shake the first in my left foot for ya babe. Spin my spin cap. Suzie’s house was pretty cool. Suzie Q. She’s a jump rump puggler. I bet she’s a real rump snuggler. Should have started the party last night. Maybe after the ride. Maybe after the ride. Maybe we’ll ride. Wake up lil’ Suzie.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">5</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What’s the biggest lake you’ve ever been in?

My muse is the morning dew. Look at what I’ve assembled. My next bold move. My big idea. I feel it’s smooth ease against the asphalt. You chose right darling, these tires are divinity. My gaggle before me peddling, they peddle for me. This is my peace. The wind picks up. I feel its rush. I feel its rush. I feel its rush. Coming over me. We are the breeze. This is my answer. This is my purpose. An answer, finally to these clipped - What is that scream? What is that screaming sound? What is that screeching sound? What is all that yelling about? Why aren’t we slowing down?

      <title>Maze Goblins: A Re-Tale</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2017/10/29/maze-goblins</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I am out too late playing with my owl friend in the cemetery wearing my princess shirt when it starts to rain. I run home with my bear dog in the wet. I get home and my dad and my freaking stepmom are making me babysit Tobe-tobe. And I’m pissed, <em>obvs</em>, because he cries like a demon and there’s a sweet freaking lightning storm approaching. I was gonna dip into the schnapps and invite Randall and the crew over for some stormy party shit. But <em>nope</em>, it’s me and freaking Tobe-tobe for the night. And he’s wearing those red and white jammies that I hate and he smells like Tobe-tobe and Tobe-tobe stinks.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So out they go, and I swear the door slams and he starts crying again, I mean the freaking twerp is screaming and I’m like, <em>TOBE-TOBE, shut up!</em> I go upstairs and tell him a killer freaking ghost story about the Maze Goblins beyond the walls of the freaky city. And I’m like, guess what Tobes, I hope you get swooped by the king of the freaking goblins, and he takes you far far away from here. So I say the words from my sweet sorcery picture book and I slam the door on the little runt.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then there’s like no more crying. Total silence. I’m thinking this is pretty sweet, and I can prolly call Randall over now, and dip into the peach schnapps. But I decide I better check on the kiddo ‘cause it’s pretty freaking spooky that he stopped crying after I said the words. And I’m thinking, could they have? Would they have? I swing open the door, and holy cow, Tobe-tobe is freaking gone! No baby in the crib. Then the window crashes open.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My owl friend shows up at the window and turns into the lead singer of twisted sister. And I’m like, what the hell? And then the lead singer says, “Hello Sarah” in a crazy sing song voice. And I’m like “damn, you’re the Goblin King aren’t you?” And he starts contact juggling with this sweet crystal ball, and I’m thinking I’m never gonna go to the lake with Randall in his truck if I don’t get my kid brother back.&nbsp;My weekend will be totally F-ing screwed. My freaking life will be screwed. So I’m like, take me to my kid brother, buster. And the Goblin King’s like, “He’s mine now, dummy,” and I’m like, “Look man, give him back, that’s not even fair.” Then he busts out this 13-o’clock clock and is like, you’ve got 13 hours to get him back, otherwise he’s the Goblin Prince. And I’m like “what the hell!” And then he turns into a snake. <em>What?</em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m left with literally no direction outside the gates of the goblin maze, which leads to the city where Tobe-tobe is. Then I see him. The little nose goblin, taking a freaking leak in the fairy fountain. I’ll never forget this guy, a nose for a face, and the smallest little legs. He’s barely bigger than my missing kid brother. This is such a total drag. He’s killing fairies with a bellows and I’m like, “Dude, cut the shit, those are the most beautiful fairies.” And then out of nowhere a fairy lands on my finger and the little nasty freaking bites me! And I’m like “that’s not fair!” And the nose goblin is like, “told you, idiot.” And I’m like, “what’s your name, nose goblin?” And he’s like, “I’m Huggles.” And I’m like, “damn, Huggles, I’m Sarah.” Then he notices my sweet bracelet, and I’m like, “do you like this thing?” And he’s like, “well, yeah, sweetest thing I’ve ever seen.” So I’m like, “look turkey-neck, take me to the center of the Goblin Maze, and I’ll let you keep my sweet bracelet.” Huggles is like, “cool. Let’s do it.” I’m like, “word little man, let’s go!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then the frigging dude totally ditches me. I can’t even believe my luck. And all the stone walls look exactly the same until I hear this eensy voice.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Aloe” says the voice.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And all I can think about is a sunburn I got last summer with Randall when we were on the lake, and the green jelly he used on my shoulders, which is absolutely freaking where I need to be right now. With Randall. In Randall’s truck. In Randall’s arms in the flatbed of his sweet Ford. Ugh. Frig these goblins and my toe-headed brother.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Aloe,” says the voice again. And I’m all, “Aloe?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Down here,” says the voice. And then I see this worm goblin with some super frizzy frizz. And she’s looking at me and blinking. Then she says, “Alo” and I get it, she’s been saying hello, but apparently everyone in the goblin maze is british.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m like, “Which way do I go?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That way,” she says and I’m thinking finding this twerp is gonna be super duper easy, way easier than the lead singer made it seem. So I tell her cool, and thanks, and then I’m like <em>bye worm</em>, and I think to myself, what a friendly little thing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So I take a left and some lefts and I’m right back at the ferry pond and here’s freaking Huggles the bracelet thief. He looks like he’s gonna jet so I grab his ear and am like, no way man, let’s freaking go - you’re leading me through this stupid thing and we’re back in the maze.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This maze sucks. Goblins turn my chalk arrows. They chitter chatter. All the door knockers talk back which is super weird. And the freaking knights with squirrels on spikes are constantly torturing something. I don’t trust Huggles. He’s always sneaking. I know he’s up to something. This big noise of this big sounding thing is freaking me out, so I’m like, Huggles, let’s see what the frig that is. And typical Huggles he’s like, oh, I don’t know if we should. So I tell him there’s more jewelry in it for him and he gets all perky about the future plastic bounty that awaits.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I wasn’t kidding about a big thing. There’s a fur centaur being snipped by the tiny knights. He’s upset and it makes me upset that he’s upset. It’s not a fair fight. It’s not fair.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I throw a stone at a knight snipper. Clank his helmet with my sweet softball trained accuracy. I really clock the little creeper. Then the fur centaur moans and another stone rolls to my feet. I’m thinking this is pretty sweet. So I wind up and clock another creeper off its lizard. The stones keep coming and pretty soon the squirrel stick having knights that ride atop the lizards flee the freaking scene.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have to go upside down to look at the fur centaur. He’s pretty cute for a beasty. Kind eyes. I let him down even though Huggles is saying not to. I clip his string and he takes a pretty harsh fall, with a loud moan, that echoes against the hedge walls. His name is Bruno. I can tell we’re already best friends. I tell him I’m Sarah, and he says, Sarah. So maybe he’s not the smartest, but he’s sweet, so he’s on the little brother finding team.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We talk to these two knockers for a while who are total bozos. I get tired of them super quick and then they push me down a tumble chamber full of groping hands. It’s creep factor 100 percent. The hands keep talking to me about how I said down, and I’m like, huh? And they push me to a tunnel. And I lose my friends.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And now I’m alone. And I’m wandering an underground woodland that has its own sky. I take a bite of a peach that Huggles gave me and I have a pretty crappy dream. The lead singer king of the Goblin City sings me this synth love jam about the world falling down and we wear masks and I’m in a wedding dress and his hair is a mushroom puff. He’s wearing lavender riding crops. It’s out of control. The freaking peach was the worst and I know Huggles did something wrong. I wake up by myself in my own bedroom with a junk goblin who keeps giving me all my old toys. She’s very in my face about taking a teddy bear and I hate her. I straight up reject the junk goblin and my room crashes down around me, and I’m in a field of junk, and that’s when I wake up and I’m back in the forest. This is where I meet the pink flamingo monsters. This place is a freaking rollercoaster, I swear.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">These guys just start singing at me. Definitely not to me, they just sing at me. And then they start taking off their heads and playing basketball with their heads and I’m freaking out because they’re super aggressive and sort of all up in my biz, and I’m like, “buzz off cretins.” But they just circle me and keep singing and it sounds a lot like “Don’t Worry Be Happy,” but like sung by Flamingo Monsters. I steal some of their heads, which they seem to have no issue without and I throw them into the trees and I run like hell to get away from these demons. And that’s when I fall down a crumbling castle wall and end up in fart central.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The rocks fart. The water farts. It’s freaking disgusting. And then I see Bruno, and then I see freaking Huggle, both trapped in the stink. I’m like, “guys,” and Bruno is like, “smells bad.” and I’m like, “No duh, Bruno, let’s get the heck outta here.” He summons rocks with moans. The rocks make the water bubble and pop, which actually makes the place smell worse by the second. But, he does get a rock path in front of us and we get to this garbage island pretty quick, which is way better than the narrow rock wall all afraid of falling in the forever stink.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So we’re on garbage island and I look at Huggles and I’m like, “Dude” and he’s like, “sorry.” And I’m like, “don’t do it again” and he’s like, “yeah, I know.” We hug, <em>it’s Huggles</em>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then out comes a dog riding a dog. It’s crazy. The rider is all dressed as a knight. The dog he’s riding is a little fluff ball, a lot like Princess Vespa, my dog. The knight dog is all, “riddle me this?” And he asks like, “how do you get to that side,” and we’re like, “uh, you cross that bridge.” Sir Coppertone or whatever his name is (god I wish I was in Randall’s truck still) and Lucious his “steed” guide us out of this hell hole and into the goblin city.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ok, so, the goblin city is ridic. There’s goblins everywhere. Knight goblins, cannonball monsters, flaming wrecks, tipped over fruit carts, rolling boulders. I can’t even take it seriously, we just start battling. I mean, throwing rocks, summoning rocks, throwing more rocks, Bruno taking on like four at a time, the dog knight and his dog biting thinks. There’s a goblin machine, that is manned by a tiny goblin that has a giant axe that destroys half the city just trying to stop me from getting by to grab my twerp brother, the prince of stupid. But, like even now, when I think of it, I’m pretty pumped I met all these weirdos, and it’s sort of his fault, so I’m like sort of grateful for that, just looking at my sweet team taking on hundreds of goblins.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">OK, so, Coppertone and Lucious destroy the goblin monster and we make it to the lead singer’s castle. I go in alone. I tell my friends, "it’s my party time," and they’re like, “make it happen.” Inside the castles is my kid brother, and the lead singer king. Oh, and like a million stairs. Sideways stairs, upside down stairs, and what does the lead singer do? He starts singing to me. He says <em>everything he’s done he’s done for me</em>. And that <em>my eyes can be so cruel</em>. And I’m like, “dude, what?” He also says he can’t "live within me,"&nbsp;and I’m like, "what? Is this a dream? Is this all a dream?"&nbsp;And then I have the power. Then I have the power, and it was right there in his freaking lyrics. Classic Lead Singer move! I can defeat him because he tells me how through his super emotional lyrics. And I’m also like, “<em>HEY GOBLIN CREEP I’M THIRTEEN!</em>”</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And then I wake up. And Tobe-tobe is crying. And I’m like <em>it was all a dream</em>, how freaking sweet, and also - <em>what? </em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But what’s weird is, a lot of my toys on my shelf have changed. And like, <em>Bruno</em> is a toy on my shelf. And <em>Huggles</em> is a toy on my shelf. And I look in the mirror. And these guys are like, “Should you need us," and I’m like, “I need you.” And then we have a sick monster dance party in my bedroom and it’s the best, and my new friends are freaking sweet, <em>freeze frame! </em></p>

      <title>Hurricane Season</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2017/10/19/hurricane-season</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Little crab in the sand. I'm half hearted. A half a heart. My own split decision. Half a man. Little hermit in a crab shell. My brain is a scramble. Pizza loving ninjas. Turtles in a half shell. What of these memories make me? They stack up. Waves against the shore. The taste of sand crystals in a sandwich. Cold bread pressed into a beach cooler. You go to war twice, the physical war and the memory. Isn’t that the way though?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">No horizon line today. No clear divides. The ocean and the air must be broadcasting my insides. How can we be so bold, to have such thoughts, to think the water thinks of us, that we have any kind of mutual understanding? Hurricane season. Islands disappearing. Bottled water sold out across the land. How can I help? Sitting on a bench. Stopping to breathe the sea air. Anonymous.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You are far away, even when we lay beside each other. When we kiss - when was the last time we kissed? I am away too.&nbsp;I read that we should take on different roles, cheat on each other with each other. Develop a fresh language of infidelity within the confines of our marriage, to forge new relationships with other versions of ourselves.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here’s an easy game to play: Meet me in a dark corner of our room. Call me by a different name. Don't be you. I won't be me. Would you take such a walk with me? Would you walk away with me? Could you? I feel you walking away. What if we about faced? Walked towards one another again, like we did many Mays ago. We ignored the posted signs and the construction, I don’t remember the sounds, the orange of the pylons blurred in my periphery while I traced the lines of your back to your heels, followed your long bright skirt to the rolled sleeves of your belly knotted shirt. You could have been leaning off the bow of a boat, there on the edge of eighth avenue, before the pavement turned to cobblestone, looking west towards the water.&nbsp;I walked towards you, waiting there, on a corner, on a street, clutching a purse. You looked up, you walked towards me.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This walk could be just a slight alteration, just a two step, a flirtatious approach, toward one another. As if we had something to gain. Don't we still? Have things to gain? I don't know everything. You should know that. I want you to know that I know that. What if we erased these expectations we’ve created, what if we ditched every default tone, what if we were open the way we were on so many first dates. These expectations are a dagger.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I arrived at the beach in the morning, on a hazy day, expecting to see the sea. I ran to the beach, peddling feet against sandy pavement. When I reached the sand the cloud-line, the haze, the mist, and the water formed a swatch of muddy white. There were no clear lines, it felt perfect, divine. We needed nothing from one another: the water, my sweat, the sea, the salt. The taste of salt. My sweet, we were one. I miss that taste, your salt. You, and me. There's a place for us,&nbsp;we'll use our legs. I walk towards you, my love, your horizon.</p>

      <title>Warming</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2017/11/5/warming</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One day I became sensitive to hot and cold temperatures. Whenever I have water I need it absolutely lukewarm. I leave the bread out. I replace my refrigerator for a little thing. I shop for the food I need, let it sit in the kitchen until it acclimates to my climate, then I prepare my meal. If I cook something hot I give myself anywhere from five to twenty minutes extra for a cool down time, though I like to call it a warming. I let the hot things warm. I let the cold things warm. I like cheese that spreads out and across like butter.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I like soft things. I suppose this has come to pass with my intolerance to extreme temperature. I like to be in cashmere,&nbsp;a cashmere shell. Lambswool is too harsh. Linen too crisp. I’ve found undergarments of the highest quality cotton.&nbsp;I load what I’m wearing into the dryer five minutes prior to getting dressed.&nbsp;I use three sheets of fabric softner in every load. When the drying is done, though I almost always check too soon, I let it sit a moment and warm.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I do the dishes in hand gloves, to preserve my skin. I found mine at a bait and tackle shop. I think they’re purpose is for clamming. But I like them for cleaning. Sometimes I joke that I’m clamming the house, and I hold my breath, wait for Sally or Marty, or whoever’s on the line, to question it. My little private joke. I love dirty jokes, though I consider myself a<em> clam </em>person.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If I get too hot when I’m bustling I’ll work only in my undergarments. If my undergarments are too hot I’ll stop working and lay on my rack. I had Marty help me with it. It’s just a thing that looks like a bench. There’s slats of soft wood that run in one direction with gaps between each one the same thickness as the wood. I lay on it if I overheat. The wood absorbs my heat and the gaps cool my back. Once, I laid face down on the slats, pressed my bosom to the lines, pressed until it hurt. I liked the sensation of the gaps against my pressed breasts. When I remind myself of this feeling I clean, hoping to get worked up again, hoping to lay back on my rack again face down, to press myself into it.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I saw your picture, your portrait, I saw you portable, couldn’t believe that you remind me of so many lovely wonders. Milkshakes from when I was the child, a cloud animal, and then I said to myself is that a woman on the beach <em>or what?</em> Couldn’t believe all the things that I saw when I saw your face, your hair spread out against the towel over the sand - all of the stuff - this is when I wrote you - because of all of the things, because of the feelings that you feel when you find a picture in a frame that is so beautiful as yours. There’s many things we walk on by in life like the hydrant on the curbside, do you think it’s average? Of course you don’t notice it! Then you think maybe it’s <em>not</em>, maybe you should! Maybe something different about it,&nbsp;maybe something even saying from inside of it, <em>take a different look</em>, <em>I’m not like the other ones</em>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Anyways, I don’t know if I love you but maybe we could <em>be</em>, maybe we should <em>be</em>, maybe-because we can, because all the time you think these things and then just once is all it takes for you to do them. Maybe it is the time we take a step, I take a step.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I saw a dead fish on the beach from the after party of a boat, in the wake of the thing, the fish came and washed the way so many fishes do, up on the shore. I thought about where the dead fishes go, I thought about all the beautiful things you could see when you walk on the beach with the rocks under your feet.&nbsp;Then I thought about all the ways, all the ways that you think, of all the weights in the weight of the water. How there is a pull from the water, like you’re weighted, like if you wait in the wake, the way you feel when you wake, sometimes, sometimes waking too heavy for this life, life is too heavy. I love to think we could be together. That’s why I wrote to you, thinking of all the maybes we could be.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The little wooden elf has long tired of being whittled. He finds a bonsai shelter in his master’s quarters. He lays beneath the delicate branches against a twisted root. He imagines the tree must be looking for escape as well. The too little woodland woodmen. He is tired of the slow cuts, and the constant body reduction. Though he is jagged, and often cuts himself on himself, he is happy this way. He would take this existence over a more refined state. He still (he checks this as he thinks it)&nbsp;has his tail. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He wraps himself in the bonsai root, takes a long snooze. Thinks about a greater forest, away from the grey stucco of this walled room. He looks up at the little leaves on the little tree. It is cold in this dirt-bed. It is not like under the light where he stands on the shelf. It is not filled with the amber glow and the long grains that run beneath his feet along the shelf floor that he counts to pass the time, his walnut bed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This tiny tree. He looks at its fine angles and pleasant demeanor.&nbsp;He thinks of his master’s hands as he traces the paths to the leaves. He thinks of the pruning process that he’s watched so many times from across this room. He recalls the snap sound of the small branches as his master snips to keep the tree growing correctly. He thinks of the way that same hand has been a bed in which he can lay. He thinks even when being scraped by the knife edge that the sound of his master’s whistle is a reward, his warm embrace, the feeling of being needed in a thumb rub.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He looks at the vacant space on his shelf across the room, looks at the circular light that he is positioned under.&nbsp;The little wooden elf looks up at the high shelf his master has chosen to place him and is unexpectedly filled with honor that he has held this vantage point all this time. He is a mighty presence in the room. He is perhaps a favorite. He thinks he ought to return to his shelf.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A golden beam announces itself against the slate path towards the front door across the room. The sun has broken through the forest line to the east.&nbsp;What forest is this? A line of trees never seen from his north facing shelf stand proudly, golden sparkles twinkle as the dew catches the sun. Dust rises and crests in countless dancing particles lit by the beam. This beam is alive and unbroken.&nbsp;He must stand in it, he must feel this glow against his wood skin. He must feel the cool air that shakes the tall branches of the large trees. He pats the root of the bonsai as if to say, <em>goodbye dear friend</em>, and leaps to his master's floor to return to the sun.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Curglepus used to count them, used to count his cups. When he was a little octorunt. When everything was octoeasy. He’d toy with the numbers, achieve the total and divide by eight, though one and four are longer tentacles than two and three, and five through eight. Nothing’s ever all that easy anymore, he’s been around too long, grown too big, eaten too many years of too many shrimp. Now these cups get stuck, with his ‘icles so thick he can’t turn them all the way round anymore. He’s lost count, couldn’t tell you how many cups even take up a single appendage. He’s lost interest in running the numbers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">His ink stock has clogged up, stopped working. He’s been drinking pen ink to make himself invisible again. He’s been gathering the fluid from the sunken ship, from the container that slides out from underneath its wood top. It’s getting hard to protect himself without his black cloud of armor. So he forrages his arsenal.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But, what’s a good place for the ocupi to occupy?” This is asked at a reef meeting. “What kind of place can they be good papis and mamis?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Where is a place where there is no place for sharks?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Take me to that place,” they are often saying to one another through bubbled gargles, latching their oh so many cups to a barnacle for a moment of peace. The cups are for peace, a symbol amongst them, to blend in to the reef, hold on while the hammerheads scout the scene.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The cups don’t uncup the way they once did. They get stuck. They used to pop, which sent a tingle down each tentacle. Each tingle sent a bubble up to the air place where the water ends, you could peel each ‘icle up slow and send a pattern of bubbles up to their eventual burst. It’s where it is lightest, where the air place begins. He used to count the bubbles too, that’s how he learned long division, sorting through the total number of bubbles, dividing them to sort out exactly how many each cup produced (3.457 - once). Now it takes Curgle several seconds to uncup each cup, the suction stuck, always in a panic, he feels old, he feels out of luck.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When the sharks have gone, given chase to a school of fools, they uncup from the reef. Released they jellyfish their way through the water, cyclone spinning their heads and tucking in the tentacles, like drills. “Let’s drill” they used to gurgle. “Let’s drill to the deep!” one would shout. “While, of course staying close to the reef.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Curgle is old, he looks at the young schools of fool fish, darting in zig zag patterns by the hundred. Quickbait, he thinks, while he slinks. He’s been here a long time, counting his cups, eyeing up the competition. He’s seen the dastardly attacks. He’s outlived his family. He watches the octorunts do their spirals, the way he used to do.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Where was he? Oh, he was testing a pen which he attached to a plastic mechanism with a trigger. He uses two ‘icles to hold and pump the machines action, another two to hold the pen, another two to hold the semi-transparent florescent tube while it fills with black liquid.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He opens the book he found in the old ship and peruses its symbols. He finds the letter S, notched in the page with a convenient place for a tentacle to lift seventy percent of the papers. He must understand what the words mean on his new defense mechanism. What is SUPER SOAKER 50?</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Archibald Archibaldovich is thirty minutes away from his own execution. Archibald's three unclipped claws are going to find their way to an empty electronic socket to the left of the credenza in the flat where he lives with Maisy St. Claire and their keeper, Thomas Tommletom. Tom-tom won’t call it a suicide, he’ll call it his big mistake, Archie’s tragic end. He’s going to order those plastic covers that plug the outlets as a safety precaution for the next one.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For these past three months Archibald’s new favorite game is taking Maisy St. Claire out of her terrarium and flipping her shell down. Maisy is simply helpless when she’s shell down, and Archibald spins the hell out of her with a happy little flick of his paw. Maisy retreats into her own soft underbelly. He likes to watch her feet and hands disappear, likes to watch Maisy’s scared little ancient face turn white. Archibald spins Maisy almost all the way until he creeps over to the socket and surrenders himself.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tom-tom found Archibald in an alley. Back then he was chasing an alley cat scrap named Harriet around dumpsters for most hours of most days. They fed on hamburgers, pizza slices, fish bones, and flies. It was what they described as a <em>boff-o sock-o</em> setup. Fly infested dumpsters and graffiti covered bricks and the occasional battle with a little army of fleas.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The worst thing that could happen for Archibald, who was then called Rick, was being chased off by a pack of rascals. The rascals were forever breaking up dates between he and Harriet, their tongues hanging out of their snouts, their one gold tooth glistening from the streetlights, their greedy paws coming after all their scraps, their pinkies pointed out, ready to scrape a kitty cat. Harriet is what Archibald will think about when the electric current runs through him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tom-tom swept him up on a day Harriet was on an expedition. The night before they’d both been chased by rascals after a feast of delicious fish bones (the silly suckers left the eyes and eye meat, <em>the sweetest bits</em>). They made a bed place inside an old rooftop water-tower, they stayed up late into the night pawing at one another, both slept in the nook of their partner’s body. In the morning Harriet was off and Rick was hungry, so he followed his stupid nose down a new fire escape into an alley he’d never been before.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then a net. Then a prick. Then a woozy wake up, and he was kept, Archibald, the house cat. He spent most of his first day staring at Maisy St. Claire through her glass box from inside a human’s place, Tom-tom’s flat. Then he looked out the windows, looking for Harriet, looking for Harriet, looking for Harriet.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Archibald lasts three months spinning Maisy St. Claire and looking out the window before placing his claw into the electric socket. Archibald is discarded into a paper bag and thrown down a metal shoot. It is unclear whether it is the smell of fish bones and old burger meat, or the familiar buzzing and twitching of so many dumpster flies, or the thud of his body against the pile, but just then Archibald Archibaldovich’s heart beat again.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He claws his way out of the paper bag, claws his way into a plastic bag of fresh fish bones, gobbles up the scraps, and exits the dumpster. His claws touch the concrete. That familiar click and clack of his walk against the stone is immensely pleasing. He is free, free to roam the alleys again, free to find his Harriet, be the Rick she once met, the Rick he was always meant to be.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong>1943</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Emus pecking up the wheat still. Holes in the fences. Rabbits slipping through the broken perimeter of every farm. Crops can’t last with holes like these. The big birds are a righteous lot. Come barreling on the horizon in a hot mob while the steam blurs the rising yellow sun in the distance. Aren’t enough people out here to stop the show. Aren’t enough heart in the hearts of men.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Old Tony’s got no surprise left for the birds. He’s seen them split mobs before. Seen a split fence, and a man chased until his legs were broke. He was here before, he fought the first infestation. “Nothing stopping them,” Old Tony says unprovoked, to a storekeeper. “Fifty kilos an hour, them. Erratic running patterns, too. Peck your eye out if they get close. Even a war weapon, a big gun, can’t run ‘em down like you’d think.” Old Tony says he’s seen an Emu take three bullets and still charge on. “Them knows what a gunshot means. And them knows how to flee it. They send scouts,” he says, “out before the rest. And they split so’s not to be corralled.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Old Tony piles a stack of meatpies atop the grocer’s counter. “You Turks make ‘em best,” says Tony to the grocer, though he’s long since abandoned their bread. “Like an anchor in your belly,” he once shouted to the man behind the counter, which led directly to a square punch to Old Tony’s face. “Them pies is nice though,” he later conceded, after the bare knuckle fight with that same grocer, and a gift of a cold beer, purchased at a rival store as an offering of peace. “And they last a good while in the ice box, a lot longer than them pillaged crops.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He buys twelve tomato-steaks. He’ll portion them out. He won’t eat the birds, and he’s killed his fare share. He’s sure that their meat will curse his body as their bodies have cursed this land. They called him out west when the guns were unsuccessful. Now, they’re pushing greater numbers, are more aggressive than before the war.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Perth.” He says it like a low belch, a wretched syllable whispered and puffed out past his dry lips. He likes to say Perth so it sounds like “death,” like death’s synonym.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Not Perth, mate,” says a man outside the general store. “Another 350 kilos west. You’ll know it when you see water.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s all Perth out here to me.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Go on then.”</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong>1928</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Old Tony was old young. On the gold coast he worked crops. Steered horses. Birthed calfs. He milked and churned. Had a fondness for animals. But the old buzzard that looked after him favored a lashing and harsh words over any kindnesses. Tony bruised easy. Kept his mouth shut. Tucked a dollar away here and there. At nine, almost five foot already, he took off North with the looks of a teenager and the skills of a farm hand, to Darwin.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here he watched the lorikeets drink themselves silly or dead, plop right down on the ground in his path. He made his home there. Once, he lifted one of them same drunk birds to try and revive the thing, rubbing his thumb slowly over its chest. He was startled when a figure’s shadow moved over his body.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Birds dead boy,” slurred the man standing above him, a man as drunk as the drunk birds in the trees all around him. Tony held the bird and squinted up at the stranger - he wore knee high boots with khaki pants tucked in, a many-pocketed vest, and round spectacles. He snatched the lifeless rainbow lorikeet from the boy’s hands, and motioned for him to follow.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They twisted down a winding path of knotted roots and dense vegetation, the strange man occasionally thrusting a long blade at a large sagging leaf. They came upon a crude shack surrounded by stuffed wildlife, an army of glass eyed creatures guarding the yard.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The taxidermist prepared his table and began to work, while young Tony, his unwitting apprentice, stood by his side. Now, a touch more sober than when he stumbled upon the boy, the man drained and then pumped the bird full of fluids. “You look old, for a fella young as yourself,” said the taxidermist leaning over, his glasses clinging to the tip of his nose. “What’s your name lad?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Tony,” the boy said.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Old Tony,” yawned the grey haired eccentric. He held the bird’s wing out away from its body as if in a curtsy. “Here. For your… troubles.” The man handed him a small wad of money. “The site of blood bother you boy? Or any of what you’ve just seen?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No sir,” said Tony, staring at the cash in hand.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s my land you’ve made your camp on. You can stay on a bit longer, but you come to me in the days, to keep up with my mess.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He’d study under the drunk the next six years, every day, cleaning the blood buckets, holding a wing in position, bending a paw, opening a jaw. He polished the instruments. He went to bed out in the jungle and reappeared each morning at the big house. Then the Doctor got the first call about them big birds.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The taxidermist wasn’t going to go. He motioned to the boy to come see him, late in the work day. They walked into the courtyard and gathered round a specimen. The stuffed emu stood six foot tall, surrounded in a circle of smaller birds. Even dead as the thing was he could see the anger in its face.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“These lot are hard to kill, boy,” said the Doctor. “Them’s are more fierce than most any land creature you’ll find. And thems’ <em>birds</em>. Smart to boot, too. Don’t look ‘em in the eye. Or if you gotta look ‘em in the eye, look ‘em serious.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The boy didn’t ask many questions. Old Tony was fifteen when he left. He spent the next three days on twice as many trains to Perth.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong>1934</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here’s fifteen year old Tony, staring at the first infestation, hired to kill by bounty. His presence is met with great skepticism.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You called the Doctor,” says Tony, “Doctor sent me.” The man stands in his wide doorway and places his square hands on his hips.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What do you know of these birds, boy?” Asks the man. “They’re very dangerous.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Do you want to see the bodies?” asks Tony. “Want ‘em brung here?” &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No. How would -”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Alright then,” the boy interrupts. “I’ll just bring the heads than. Five a piece. Per bird. Like what you told the Doctor.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tony kills the emus with mercy. He doesn’t affiliate himself with the mess of guns. He hunts the birds with a knife. Sleeps in the brush, camps in a small pitch, lighting herbs around him to ward off mosquitoes and snakes. In the day he stays close to the ground until a mob comes grazing towards him. Then, he kills them individually, slicing a neck here, wrestling a body close to the earth before poking it with his blade. He knows how to drain the blood, knows how to preserve their shape, to kill them with some sense of respect, whatever is left for the flightless things, already born without dignity in their ridiculous bodies.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The boss man opens his door to the same boy he sent away three days prior. Tony carries a heavy bag over his shoulder. He slings it on the floor.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Them’s thirty,” says the boy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Thirty birds?” asks the man.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You count ‘em.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That won’t be necessary,” says the man pulling out his billfold. He hands Tony an offering.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“How many more do you want?” asks the young man.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“As many as there are,” replies the landowner.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This exchange is repeated again and again over the next several weeks. Couple of years back the government had sent a general and a pair of Lewis guns to the area in hope to mow the birds down. But the emus could take the bullets and still charge. The birds would split up in separate mobs when the gunfire started, and the humans couldn’t keep up. That was 1932. A month of shooting 10,000 rounds of ammo killed less than a thousand birds. Then they started accepted bounties.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The weeks go by quickly. The boy comes up to the door every few days, throws his satchel down. He produces 60, 70, 80 heads. The man at the house offers him food, lodging, a wash. The boy just looks up each time, and says, “more tomorrow.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On the first day of the sixth week Old Tony drops his last pile, ending with the thud of his 330th head.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s it, boy,” says the man, handing over yet another wad of money, darkness in his eyes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“More birds out there,” says the boy, who’s been sleeping who knows where these past five weeks. He stinks, he seems unaffected by the killing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Come in boy. Have a shower at least.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No need,” says Tony. “I’ll just head on back.” &nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The taxidermist reluctantly accepts some of the money. He separates the stack in two and hands Old Tony back half.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You alright by it?” asks the Doctor.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Was fine,” says the boy. “Ain’t &nbsp;get much sleep though.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You go to sleep then, here, in the house.” The Doctor points to a room on the far end of the terrarium. “Room in the back is cleared out. Yours if you want it.” The boy nods appreciatively and eases his way to his new quarters where he sleeps for three days.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The boy is forlorn upon returning, dead-eyed, bored. The taxidermist gives him more rest, asks less of his chores, watches him sink into his body, thinning. He lets a beer slide now and again into the boy’s paws and sees him take a liking to it. Tony grows stone-eyed quickly in the evenings, belching his way to sleep, waking with the looks of a pale wrestling spirit. The taxidermist insists he boot up the bad stuff and get on with it. Tony quietly obliges.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the early evening under the pelting beats of another heavy rain, and the rolling squeaks of the surrounding birds the Taxidermist bent over his microscope has he straightened some feathers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Did it bother you.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The blood? You’re always asking me -”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I don’t want to scar you, boy.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They’re dead. What else can they be after dead?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I like to think that what I do keeps ‘em alive, in some respect.” The boy stares out at nothing in the woods.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s nice. All them birds I killed out west, only thing that didn’t sit right was I ain’t bury ‘em.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Too many to bury.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Them’s were too many. But it aren’t right to have left ‘em.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tony takes the Doctor’s boots off when he passes out drunk, saves his glasses from being bent, broken, or lost, catalogues the work. All the while he puts on the pounds too, stays up late into the night drinking alone, studying the Doctor’s collection.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The years pass. Tony gets used to the cycles of his mentor, most alive with a new discovery, a specimen to study from after stuffing, to paint. He illustrates and paints every bird, documenting their color pigments, beak shape, claw configuration, working well into the nights.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You’re good with the work,” says the taxidermist one morning, over an already cold cup of coffee. “It suits you.” The boy nods. “And if left to myself, none of these would be as well collected and preserved without you.” The boy nods again quietly repositioning a bird of his own. “And you have no family.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“None to speak of,” said the boy coolly.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Very well,” says the man, like it’s a game they play.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Late 1942, a telegram arrives from the west: “Infestation is back. Need an expert. Never really went away. Send the boy.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tony brings the mail to the taxidermist in the terrarium. It is mid-afternoon. He swells with the unease of so many trains again, though it’s been years. What he thinks about mostly is the quantity of the kills. On his way to the terrarium, slipping out of the side room off the kitchen, along the well-worn path between the building and the glass extension off the back of the house he sees the tall emu standing in the yard and approaches it, stares deeply into the marble of an eye. It is only getting this close to the bird as to blur its shapes that Tony’s eyes focus past it. There in his glass room is the figure of his mentor slumped over his desk and a dark pool of blood under his head, his usually orderly papers scattered across the room like he was looking for something in a hurry..</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tony lifts the head of the man off his desk to check for life, though he knows a dead thing when he sees it. The doctor appears to have choked on his own blood, Tony links the man’s coughing fits to the rest. TB or some such thing the boy surmises. He leaves the man, there at his desk surrounded by the stone eyes of the frozen creatures. He finds a shovel, throws the man’s body over his shoulder and buries the taxidermist in the dirt.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He doesn’t respond to the telegram. He sorts through the vast collection the taxidermist left in his wake and reorganizes by species and type. Hidden beneath the thick blood atop his desk Old Tony then comes across an unfamiliar document. Under a gold seal and some fancy type are the words “Deed of Land” and beneath that Tony’s own name. The land is his. He cleans the place spotless, then purchases all the train tickets necessary to get out west.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong>1943</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The locals are going mad over the new infestation. Thirty thousand birds is what they say. One to one, they say. Human to bird. They plow through the fences, peck up the posts. It is war all over again. A war already lost when the boy was a boy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Old Tony walks out into the field, his knife in hand, his stomach full of the dense bread of a tomato-steak pie. He approaches the flock cautiously, ready to make his kill. He eyes the stoic one, standing steady, meeting his gaze. Tony doesn’t break his slow pace as he nears him. Standing a foot from the large eye of this ridiculous animal Old Tony closes his eyes, he navigates his hand, hovering over the back of the bird. Tony’s hand slowly, steadily rises to grab the back of its neck. When his fingers reach feathers he lightly grazes the great bird’s neck. He lands his palm softly against the neck, curls his fingers gently against the bird. Old Tony leans his head towards the bird, rests his forehead against the bird’s ridiculous face and weeps.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In a large field in Western Australia that is not quite Perth, but might as well be in his eyes, Old Tony pierces the dirt with the knife given to him by a doctor on the other side of the country and quietly walks away.</p>

      <title>Antonio, the Elder</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2017/10/25/antonio-the-elder</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Antonio, the Elder ponders the rock wall.&nbsp;He sets himself under a tree that cuts through the line the short wall creates high on the hill looking over the pasture, separating the grass from the neighboring road. Beyond the road a forest sprawls into the hillside.. “These cobbled stones,” he says aloud, “what a marvelous collection.” <em>A sturdy wall</em>, he thinks sliding his hand against a round stone atop so many others, such capable human hands. <em>But what if it weren’t arranged by us at all?</em> he muses.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He imagines the brief reign of a towering tree living on the hilltop, an army of fallen branches taken as its slaves at war with the rock dwellers in a since-covered quarry far below. Of course the fallen branches disliked the rock dwellers. Of course a fragile thing would start a fight with one that's made of stone.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The rock dwellers, he smiles at the thought of them, such round and clunky little beings with their crooked cracked faces and blunt grunts for words. They smash things to bits, roll the bits to where they need them - of course they haven’t fingers or thumbs, just fists. They push a thing, use force to propel movement. They hammer their little fists against -</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Is this the Elder?” interrupts a passerby. Antonio looks up, squinting his eyes at a figure in the shadow of the bright midday sun.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I am just a man,” says Antonio, brushing off the visitation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But you are also this man, whom I seek," says this strange,&nbsp;thin man.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I know not what you seek,” says the Elder. “I am simply a man who currently guides this charcoal stick unto this piece of paper against this wooden board.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Are you not the man known as Antonio?” asks the interrupter.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I have been called many things,” answers the Elder. “What is your inquiry?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I am something of an artist myself, sir,” says the man, now blocking the Elder’s sun.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Please, I haven’t time for sirs, young man,” spurts the Elder.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I wonder if you have any advice,” asks the interrupter.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Of course, an old man sits before you who is really not that old in the grand scheme of time. I am swollen with advice,” says Antonio, “filled to the brim." The Elder looks away from his visitor, cranes his neck out along the pasture, for the first time noticing some cows out in the distance that may not have been there when he first sat. He begins again, his face turned from this stranger, "I will tell you this, young man. When you see a man thinking alone along a rock wall such as this one, do not interrupt that man’s line of thought. The magic comes when we reach our destination.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh dear,” says the man, “my apologies -”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Enough!” shouts the Elder with a clap of his hands that echoes back from the pasture. “Be, man. Be what you are meant to be. Listen to your own self, and move on from here, for I am pondering the existence of this wall.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Of course, Elder,” grovels the interrupter. “But surely," the old man's shoulder's tense as his tormentor continues,&nbsp;"this wall exists. You sit atop it.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Great gods,” yelps the Elder, who then noticeably relaxes over the thought as it turns, “I am not questioning the wall’s place here," he smooths the stone with his palm,&nbsp;"I am merely thinking of the paths from whence it came to be.” Antonio looks away, adjusts his tunic under him, the cloth twisted from turning towards the interrupter. <em>Where was he?</em> Thinking about this rock wall. Thinking about a war between rocks and trees.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Will you draw the wall?” asks the interrupter, startling the Elder.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“My stars,” says the old man, “are you still here? I will draw what I come up with when I have the time to think it. It is no concern of yours what shapes will be formed on this piece of paper.” He takes a long look at the interrupter, his tunic a little too loosely fit around the shoulders. The boy could use a soup or chicken leg or some such thing. This is a thin and muscular creature, standing before him. He briefly envisions him in the leather armor of a spartan, with the long athletic sandals tied close to his knees. Perhaps he would draw this version of the young man from memory later.&nbsp;“From which way, <em>did you say</em>,&nbsp;have you come to be here?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I came just from that path there,” responds the man quickly.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I beg you,” says the Elder, patting the air with his long fingers. “Think before you speak, man. I am not interested in the road from which you traveled, I am only inquiring after the path that brought you here to me.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I see,” says the interrupter. “Before I traveled this road I came to be in this town by carriage. I came here, to tell it briefly, sir, to find you.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well,” shouts the Elder with his arms outstretched, “I am here on this wall formed by capable hands many years before either you or I came to be things that are known at all. You, sir, have indeed found me.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The nature,” says the interrupter, “of my voyage -”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“This is a predictable farce, sir!” whispers the Elder close to this stranger’s ear, now indulging himself as much as his passerby. “You’ve not come here to find me, you are only looking for <em>your</em> self!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Sir, I believe,” says the stranger, “you see, my mother spoke to me of this place, told me if I sought you, here you would be.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What do you believe to be,” says the Elder rolling his eyes in a dramatic fashion, “my son, or some such thing?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Indeed,” says the stranger.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And you are looking for what, exactly?” asks the Elder.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I came to introduce myself,” says the stranger, “to you.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You are an earnest thing,” says the Elder. “What do you have to say? Am I now meant to live a life changed with this knowledge?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I only seek to answer your query,” says the stranger. “I suppose I stand here, both physically and <em>universally</em>&nbsp;because of you.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Antonio the Elder, opens his mouth, raises a finger in the air to speak. He takes a long break from movement, retracts the finger and closes his mouth. He collects his paper and board, slips it within a folded leather portfolio and rises from the short cobblestone wall, patting the rock once more affectionately. “Another time for you, my dears” he whispers to the rocks. The old man again adjusts his cloth wardrobe around his body for it to fall in the appropriate way, tightens his sandals for his long walk home.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Antonio, the Elder is already several meters away from this supposed son when he stops and says, "You can spend an eternity looking at that wall of rock, young man.&nbsp;I imagine you’d best come with me...&nbsp;if you care to survive. It’s only a matter of time before those rocks and that tree are in a quarrel again. There’s no telling what will come of that.”</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Chip tells me to be ready and I am ready. “We are gonna flip it. Flip it and tumble,” is how he says it. Chip likes to say, “ride or die.” I like to respond, “fight or flight.” We take donuts and figure eights pretty serious, trying to throw ourselves off the ATV, out by the tarpits where the pterodactyls used to make familiar circles in the sky, screeching and cawing. But that was in the prehistory. And we are passed the regular history, even. <em>We’re post history</em>,&nbsp;is how Mama would say it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They will call me thunder foot,” I tell Chip buckling the helmet strap beneath my chin, before we are airborne. “I will be a million feet tall.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You’re full of BS,” is what chip says to my heightened dreams. “I will be a fire god,” he shouts. “I will be born of flame! The heat won’t bother me!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s a little too close to home, bud,” I whisper.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Sorry,” he yells, and giggles. I forget his giggles until I hear them and I love him the most when they happen, I love him most when I’m reminded.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We used to make snow angels. Before Chip was big enough, when he was just a blob who pointed to things and I brought the things he pointed to to him. This is when there was snow. I remember baby Chip and this snow. When the swimming pools were filled in the summer, and the tubs were warm at night, me and Mama and Papa, and then Chip. Before the droughts, before the ocean water conversions, before the electric war. Before the empty houses and buried bodies. Before it was just us.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">By the tarpit at the end of the world we let the tires make the shapes and spin out the mud and dirt in a radical spray against the amber sky. &nbsp;We’ve made frozen waves in the dirt here, formed hills from our treads. Chip’s a natural rider. He takes the appropriate risks and I have to let him have it. It calms him. I can see it wash over him as he drives. I watch his shoulders sink into the motion. He leans against the sharp turns. He moves into the jumps and coasts over the leaps, his body limp and peaceful.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I passed out on the diving board after sucking can berries again. They help fill the gaps between water rations and wheat puffers. I had a pretty powerful trip and awoke in a very wiggly haze. I imagined my bones shattered and my arms broken and all I wanted to do was climb out of an empty pool but the walls were too high and too curved. I was trapped. I remember feeling the teeth of the drain monster just before I woke up. Then I checked to see if I was a full body. Chip was there shaking me awake saying “Dude, you could fall off the board and split your freaking head against the pool bottom and then it would just be me.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I remember I have to stay alive for Chip. I remember I must stay alive because I remembered the before time and somebody’s got to. Not that any of that matters now. Now that we’re here alone.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Papa drove us here in the old pickup. He strapped the ATV to the bed and squeezed us in. Mama was already fighting back home and Papa was the only one who knew the trails to the house by the tarpits. They used to call it the lake house. This is back when there were things called lakes. He must have stocked it for years with the canned rations. But he couldn’t have known about the berries. He wouldn’t like that I eat them, he’d prolly say,&nbsp;<em>those are for adults</em>. But he also said he’d be back and even Chip has stopped asking about a return.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We came up with this story together. Mama took the last plane ride to a water island to find a drought cure. Papa fought with the sisters of the revolution, after mama was gone to bring them to the hidden places to prevent men from claiming them as wives. Then papa drove west, into the canyons of the burnt sea, out and out and out to the place where mama is. There they’re finding a way back to us, even though we know it isn’t true, we hold onto it. It’s a lot like the way I hold onto Chip, who they called Jacob. When he flips us and we’re tumbling in the air our bodies twist with every turn. I squeeze my baby brother tight in case we’re both ghosts already and we just don’t know it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">&nbsp;</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">David and Christine didn't get a look at it. Neither can say for sure its color or shape. They’re both left feeling helpless about it. The boys from the empty pools are gone. Their thin little skeletal frames are nowhere in sight. And the cans - the cans are gone too. The overdry pools are empty, clean. Makes David think a vacuum played a role in whatever has them now, some long and terrifying thing that can lift a human body this way, by use of suction, by way of tube.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">David replays their discovery of the boys in his head. The boys and their berries. He and Christine made their way through the open front door, past the ransacked house, through the merlot covered carpet. They followed the shuffling sound coming from out back, like a pack of dogs rummaging. What he wouldn’t give for that kind of companionship, a little crew to run wild with.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Shirtless boys languidly paced around the lips of empty swimming pools, discarding beer cans into each, filling the bases of the empty pool shapes: rectangles, kidney beans, lima beans, squares. The beer cans lay with dead palm fronds from distant seasons. The empty pool bottoms were full of them, as are the once lively patios, the places of leisure that once overlooked pools filled with aquamarine water. Each of the bone-starved teens carry a can in one hand as they lift and shake the other cans, looking for something.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What do you get out of it?” David asked a boy. “They cannot hydrate.” The boy glared at this fully dressed man as if he’d blinded him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The berries,” he said, low and guttural, from a mouth David could taste the dryness from.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Berries at the bottom of the cans,” said another boy, taller, even leaner than the other one, eyes rolled way back, slumped against the red clay pool deck. He creaked his neck towards David and Christine. “They got something in them that helps.” He rattled his can, tilted his head way back, tapped its bottom to catch what was left in his mouth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The boys kept sucking yeast from the corpses of cans while they watched. Each pellitt emits a moment of elation, like a burst of moisture on the tongue. David always had a protective foot slightly in front of Christine, in case the pack grew restless. It’s more terrifying to stare at the deserted than it is to flee in a panic. There’s so much hunger in the eyes of the young. David and Christine are nearing forty - that puts them at a major disadvantage. They may be hungry, but they will always be hungrier, they’ve known the feeling of being full. To the boys, life is all change, it’s these intruders that are doing it wrong. To these boys it is already so, and was so, and will be so.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is foreign ground now, David thought then. The way these boys looked at them with their cavernous eyes and gummy mouths. He clenched his car keys in his pants’ pocket, released them. He eased his shoulders, tried not to show his discomfort to Christine. <em>Act natural</em>, he kept telling himself.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This place reminds him of Scottsdale when he was a kid. Already as hot back then as it is here now: blow-dryer hot, without a hint of a breeze. David and Christine are already on the run, but they didn’t expect to stumble upon this.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This was David’s mother’s house. His parents’ house actually before they divorced, a place of parties and talking and music and dancing. His parents were a furnace in the room, lighting it, filling all that visited with a sense of their warmth. The plants are just dead stems now. A palm tree was planted when he was young, here, in upstate New York. His dad laughed and said it seemed like “a goddamned joke.” David has a funeral for fall in his head, a trumpet blows. Christine often talks about the leaves falling and the eventual snow, and then the thaw. They’re chasing the last signs of cold weather. They heard Canada is sealing its borders to Americans any day now. &nbsp;But who can be sure?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They barely have time to inspect his mother’s house, barely remember what they came here for because of the disturbing discovery of the skeleton crew, and their even more terrifying disappearance. Just being here means they’re already behind. The state is now officially deserted. The kids were already deserted, and now they’re gone too. Who took all these deserted kids? Just teenagers. They looked like little old men. He finds the safe behind the headboard of his mother's bed. Removes the towel wrapped weapon.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Before they climb into the car in the dead of night David double checks to see that he left the door lock open on the house, as if it will help. “Stupid old man,” he says to himself. He rattles the word around in his head, old, smells the temperature rise off the blacktop. He gets in the car.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">David pictures empty beach chairs in parking lots where the pavement keeps rubbing off on his shoes. He imagines the parking lot like the sand on beaches he went to when he was young. He thinks of beaches. Of that beautiful push and pull of the water. He stops himself at water as Christine yawns beside him. He wants to sneak a ration, wants to share one with her, &nbsp;he relents.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I have to believe,” David says to Christine, “that it’s peaceful, that they’re safe.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But it’s probably not. I’m sure that it’s not,” Christine says back, looking at the stripes dashing beneath them on the faded grey highway as the sun blazes above them. “I heard the sound, David, like a jet engine, like some big moving thing.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tomato on calendar. Who calls calendar calendar? We call calendar calendar. We lose the. We lose the all <em>the</em> time. Anytime we can lose the, we ditch the. No to the. No to determiner. We call calendar calendar. We grab shoe and coat and head to store for coffee and tomato.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We have tomato in hand. We cut tomato. Who is we? We are we.&nbsp;I is not we. We say no to I.&nbsp;We is easier. Easier to say what we mean as we. We wrap fingers around knife. We lift knife over tomato, way after we lift pen to calendar. Way before arm guides wrist, before line forms circle. Our brain signals arm.&nbsp;Circle is tomato. We say our. Our brain. We want it to stay. You.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We dice tomato. We place onion in pan. We smoosh garlic with knife. We unwrap paper. We don’t hear your soft steps on wood floor. We only hear paper crinkle. Vegetable skin. Tomato paper cutter. Three hole punch sound. Knife slices tomato. Hand slides off knife. Hand slides down your back. Our hand. Your back.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We use your. We use you too. You get caught in we. Even if we aren’t referring to you, at all. We say at all. Even you are not a part of that all. All. We all. We all see tomato. We all see calendar. We touch date in box before we open door. We blow date a kiss. A single kiss. A kiss off. A list kiss.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You drew tomato. Friendly tomato. You drew tomato in box. Tomato with face. Winking tomato. Tomato with smile. Not in tomorrow’s box. Box from weeks ago. You drew tomato in box. Box is a day. A day we met. Day we met, only weeks ago. You left your mark on me. The day we met.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Peng walked along an ancient road in an ancient place, fashioned in a robe he forced himself to make. He remembers working the needle over and over, his hands shaking to thread through its eye in the dark, connecting the three large patches of material. He remembers the poor first attempts of his early stitches, subject to rules implemented before he existed. The method was built in conversations held in the wakes of ocean waves, in river beds, on high mountains along paths of epic pilgrimages, in corners of straw huts, over hand built tables, before his parents existed, a time few could trace to its origin.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He does not remember when the stitch became a pattern that his hands understood, he only knows that suddenly the act was thoughtless, and yet full of thought, methodic, delicate, strong, he was in control of the needle, and the needle he threaded through the fabric would become a house for his body to fill day by day. When the garment was complete he pulled the early stitches and applied his new techniques, cleaning the crude work of his first pass with newfound pride.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He wore his robe proudly around his body when he finished it. This garnered a lash from his parents. Afterwards he walked with his head bowed in reverence. He walked near the fountains and coy pools. He walked through temples, eventually, and quite accidentally, led himself into a monastery. He took to reading for days on end. He studied Mahāyāna. He circled the paths on maps that would have brought this school of Buddhism to China. He circled the flaming mountains, and imagined a pattern of temples along the way. He dreamt of Xuanzang meeting the venerable Silabhadraidea. He constructed a pilgrimage of his own.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Before departing his city, a decade after he first dreamt leaving it the young monk brought a clay bowl to the water of a familiar pond. As he raised the dish to his lips he saw the tiny squirming swimming thing within it. It was no fish, and couldn’t possibly be a frog. He could only hope he’d scooped up a lizard, as such a beast would make a stealth traveling companion. A lizard would surely traverse the mountain passes with little needs. A lizard could enter the holy temples undetected in the folds of a young monk’s robe.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Peng cradled the bowl in a fish net, attached the net to a stick, and rested the stick over his shoulder. Here his companion could sway as he walked with water to swim in and grow. He too would journey west. The path of the silk road would be shared. He called him Haisu, Peng held his thumb to the water’s surface, and the tadpole swam loops grazing its back against its master. On their way out of Luoyang, Peng led his free hand over small rock walls, miniature plants, and bushes. He whispered goodbye in his mind to the pond and thanked it for his city’s final gift to him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">About two kilometers out of the city’s walls a man rushed to Peng, with his foot aflame. Peng quickly removed a piece of fabric from his rucksack and smothered the flame. The robed stranger stood above the extinguished man and extended his arm. The man’s leg was badly burned. He took Peng’s hand and placed his own arm over Peng’s shoulder. With his help the two made their way on three legs to the burned man’s shack where the small fire that burned him blazed on.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With quiet purpose Peng laid the man atop his cot and extinguished the flames inside the hut. Before leaving the hut he placed Haisu on the sill of the hut to swim about his bowl in the warmth of the afternoon sun.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Peng was angry with himself. Angry at his own impatience. It perturbed him, stopping, and helping this man. He was after all, a man on mission. <em>But who’s mission?</em> This came from a voice deep inside Peng’s mind. It circled around his skull. He stopped in his tracks, sat on a low wall, watched a wild dog chase a bird. <em>If you want to go faster</em>,&nbsp;he thought to himself in a low,&nbsp;shameful tone, <em>find a horse</em>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Upon his return to the hut Peng brought a variety of leaves from which he extracted liquids and proceeded to rub into the man’s burnt leg. He wrapped the leg in thin cloth from a basket in the man’s hut.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The man awoke the next morning to Peng dishing rice into a bowl, a quiet sound, the spoon churning the soft steamed rice, the soft rice hitting the porcelain bowl. The hut smelled clean of yesterday’s fire. Peng brought the rice to the man in the cot.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I have no money to pay you,” said the man to Peng, who gently smiled back. “But I’d like you to have that there.” The man pointed to a lantern hanging by his hut’s door frame. “Let it light your journey.” Peng nodded towards the man and lifted the lantern from its hook.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Peng understood that he and Haisu’s journey was not a straight line, but a jagged path. As Peng unfolded his crude map he built a code upon which to live. If a man asked of him his help, then Peng would help.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The flaming mountains were a few months walk. It took Peng and Haisu two years to reach them. The sand announced itself like a fiery ocean. The mountains were as they had been profesized to him, alive against the bright blue sky. He would think they were confronting the air had they not brought such balance to the landscape.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Though many stops were made along the way Peng had recently grown shy in his glances, keeping his head bowed low as they walked. Haisu had grown out of his bowl and was now riding cradled within the folds of Peng’s robe. The more his companion grew the more unlizardly he became. In the folds of his neck grew a mane of hair, and his face was that not of a lizard but of animal origin. Peng took to thinking of Haisu as a serpent lion as if this was commonly known. He believed him to have special powers though nothing in Haisu’s behavior had affirmed this feeling.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Late one night while in the mountains long cast shadows moved against the large curved red rocks. The cackle of laughter echoed across the cavernous pass. Haisu fled his rock, escaping to the folds against Peng’s chest where his heartbeat would soothe him. The laughter grew closer and the shadows crisped into familiar shapes: human bodies dragging carts and carrying flags were approaching. <em>This cannot be an army</em>, Peng thought to himself, <em>for this group is far too small to be an army</em>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The troupe approached, and Peng had his answer: a traveling theatre. They wore bright crimson cloaks and held wild blue and green flags. A portly man wore an ancient set of armor, his moustache pointed far beyond the curves of his round cheeks. They had wind chimes tethered to their carts, and rice steaming from a heavy clay pot held between a boy and an old man. They had rouged cheeks and carried jugs of wine in their hands.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What is this?” shouted the knight as they approached the quiet man huddled against the rocks behind his modest fire.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“A fellow traveller!” shouted a man that most resembled a serpent himself, with a slither in his speech like his tongue might slip all the way out of his mouth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“My good man, here” said the big man, presenting a jug of wine to Peng. Peng did his best to protest this offer, thanking them with his hands, patting the air and smiling.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Ah, a quiet man,” said the portly knight. “A man of god. Dear sir, don’t you know that wine is of the earth, that it is meant to be slurped up over great conversation. Just then Haisu repositioned himself against Peng’s chest and the big man jumped back. “What do you stow there, sir?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Again, Peng patted the air and smiled, though this time his nervousness could not be abated. The large man drew closer to this foreigner, stuck out his walking stick and lowered the fold of Peng’s robe. Haisu, startled at being awakened, jumped to attention and scurried up the knight’s stick. And here a marvelous thing happened, the serpent lion opened its mouth and let out a large and dangerous flame. The portly man dropped his stick and fell back.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We mean no trouble,” said the knight, dragging himself away from the fire by his elbows. “We’ll be on our way.” Quickly the troupe bustled away from the robed man and his lizard.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">From this point forward Peng traveled with Haisu proudly atop his shoulders from place to place, the monk and his serpent lion became an attraction all their own. Children would approach gravely and then beg to pet the beast’s scales again. Peng would bend his knee for them to graze Haisu’s scales. Haisu would let out a small vibration of a pur that would raise the hairs on their little arms.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It was a nearly twenty year journey to reach Yemen. The same piece of wood from which he once hung Haisu’s bowl became a walking stick for Peng, who then, only near fifty years old had developed a slight hunch in his stance from years walking with his companion around his neck. Of course over time the serpent lion grew too large for Peng to carry at all. A decade into his journey the beast was nearly as large as Peng himself from head to tail. Haisu walked alongside his companion happily, like a dog would its master.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When they arrived at the monasteries, thousands of kilometers and decades of travel between them, the holy men were aghast that Peng would dare attempt entry with such a beast. They laughed him off the long steps, shooed him and his companion away.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Peng made camp there, on the steps of the monastery. For seven nights he fasted while waiting for them to open their doors to him, to open their arms. He’d traveled too far to give up. On the eighth day he awoke to found they had been moved. How they’d moved Haisu he could not understand. But, these were holy men and he knew to ask the question was to question their very ability.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Peng was humiliated. This ridiculous journey. All this time, following a western star, to meet a holy man, to understand some greater meaning. He expected to find open arms awaiting him and his extraordinary pet to stay within the walls of the monastery. Left on yet another street, after hundreds of streets, for a night after thousands of nights to make shelter, Peng promptly exchanged the city for a return to the mountains.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Peng spent days in the mountains, picking, as he’d grown accustom, crude shrubs and berries. It was here that he fell ill from the fruit of a poisonous plant. And it was here, at the mouth of a cave that he met another exiled man, a man who patted his chest with the tips of his fingers and whispered, “Omar.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Omar bowed to Haisu before tending to Peng, whom he lifted and carried inside the cave. The smell was like nothing Peng had ever encountered, wafting into his nostrils, a mixture of burnt cocoa, cardamom, and cinnamon. In a thin porcelain pan Omar shuffled green beans that when roasted turned dark and produced the smell that filled the cave.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After the green beans were roasted brown Omar took a rounded stick and slowly crushed them within another porcelain dish into powder. Omar brought water to a boil over an open flame, poured it over the dark powder, and made black liquid. He brought a cup to Peng’s lips and had him slowly drink this strange tea.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Peng was quickly himself again, and anxious to thank his host. Looking around his surroundings Peng saw that the cave was as modest a place as Peng himself would have sprung up for an evening’s camp. He would find a way to show his gratitude.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I was a healer” Omar told him in a language he could not understand. Realizing all would be lost in translation Omar again brought his hands to his chest, repeating his name, then placed his fingers against Peng’s stomach and stirred them in a circle against it. He then took both hands and placed them over one another and quickly spread them away from the stranger’s stomach. Peng understood this sign for vanishing, or clearing, smoke as an indication of Omar’s powers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Peng spent several days in the cave with this other kind of holy man, watching him bring in bowls of the mysterious green beans. He watched him make fire after fire, sometimes twisting a twig into some brush until his hands shook, then he roasted the beans in his small pan, made another cup of the liquid, passed it towards him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On the fifth day Omar awoke to an empty cave. His visitor and his strange beast were nowhere to be seen. He tended to the cave, gathered his pans and bowls to bring to the river. Huddled by the riverbed he saw a twinkle in the water, was shocked at a creature advancing in his direction. The serpent lion darted from the water towards the unexpected host and licked the man’s face with his sandpaper dry tongue. Across the river sat Peng smiling as he watched his companion embrace another.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The group made their way up to the cave together that evening stopping along the way to pick the green beans from their beautiful plants. The way Omar caressed each leaf showed a reverence to the wildlife. He picked the beans gently, and Peng assisted him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the morning all of the beans were black, as if one hundred small bowls were filled and held over Omar’s tiny fire.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“How did you do this?” he asked his silent guest. Peng let the slightest smirk creep across his face before motioning to Haisu. As if on cue the creature belched a flame that made the owner of the cave laugh out loud. “Incredible.” The creature then stuck its snout into a pile of the roasted beans and began chewing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No!” shouted Omar waving his hands at the serpent lion. Peng raised his palm up to his host, and as he had done to a hundred other men along his journey, he brought the hand down slowly, patting the air, asking for a moment of calm. The two men watched the creature chew and chew the beans in its closed mouth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Peng stood, arranged his robe, walked to Haisu, and placed his cupped hands under his mouth. Out poured perfectly ground beans. Omar’s eyes welled up at the site of it, these two mysterious travelers, where did they come from?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Yemen bustled. Men with carts, men with chickens, men in the makeshift marketplaces selling fruit. And that inescapable smell wafting in and out of the streets coming from the two robed men with their wooden cart and strange lizard. The dark liquid was said to heal. The word spread and they were welcomed everywhere with their beast in tow.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One day, after many months trading the dark liquid outside the monastery, Omar, the coffee maker, looked over at Peng, traced the outline of the man up and down and said with words that were now familiar to his companion, “They wouldn’t let you in, and they wouldn’t let me in, and still you don’t speak. Wouldn’t it be wonderful for us to know,” and here he admiringly looked at the serpent lion at their feet, “what to call our companion.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Much to Peng’s surprise he opened his mouth. For the first time in thirty years a word escaped his lips. He whispered, “Haisu.” The serpent lion looked up at his master, Peng laid a hand through his mane. The beast coiled his tail around Peng’s leg and fell into a deep sleep, bathed in the light of a particularly golden sun, breathing in the familiar scent of the beans he crushed in his mouth daily, his body warming his master’s feet.</p>

      <title>Ant</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2017/11/29/ant</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ant crawls down the willow tree. Ant makes her way down down down. She is wingless, a scout, a warrior for her queen, <em>infertile</em>. Just thinking this garners sympathy from Antt who is now beside her, waving an antenna, providing support. Antt is misreading her and is overly sympathetic, but Ant doesn’t mind her company. They march two by two down the tendrils of the drooping tree. They hum the human song. They greatly dislike the human song. But they do enjoy the drumming. They tap their tarsal claws against the leaves and hold their funiculus low to soak in the beat.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ant stops to itch her scutellum. Antt stops when Ant stops. Anttt and Antttt crawl up beside the stopped pair. <em>Were you humming the song?</em> Anttt asks Antt.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>We were humming the song</em>, they admit.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>We picked up your rhythm</em>, transmits Antttt to Ant and Antt, <em>We were on branch 342. </em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Good catkins on 342</em>, transmits Antt to the Antt+s.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Great catkins</em>, Anttt and Antttt respond.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Without a word between them they all continue down the willow tree, four by four. They hum the song. They beat their tarsal claws against dewey branches and flowers and leaves. They transmit their feelings to one another silently, without a buzz, as a unit, the familiar words of their daily paths:&nbsp;<em>lift</em>, and <em>pull</em>, and <em>together</em>, and <em>tuck</em>, and <em>freeze</em>. They’ve hidden under a sneaker tread, have felt their hard encasings squished flat and reshaped. They’ve lifted the large crumbs as gifts and pulled the loose dirt up from the pile to form another path to their queen.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Through a clearing in the branches they all spot it, located behind the sleeping pair of humans. <em>Basket</em>, they universally transmit. And then, they see the dark brown pools in the white cups. <em>Coffee</em>. And lastly, <em>Sugar</em>, <em>the pure stuff</em>, <em>in cubes</em>. Other Ants join them, filed in rows. They are eight. They are sixteen. They are a drip, then a creek, then a river flowing towards the earth, the willow's drooping tentacles brushing the fertile ground beneath them. The colony lifts cube after cube in their mandibles, collecting as a group a large bounty for their queen.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After the haul, on the long walk back the four Ants find themselves again near one another, among the massive colony, past the hefty roots of the willow, up so many branches, they lift and carry.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Infertile</em>, Ant thinks again, and the thought is there for the others to share, vibrating through the sugar cube.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>It is your way, transmits Antt</em>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>It is our way, transmits Anttt</em>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>It is the only way there can ever be</em>, adds Antttt.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Again Ant wishes only to seek cover from the kindnesses, wishes to dig herself into a hole of her own.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>But there is not such a hole</em>, interrupts Antt.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>And there is not another way</em>, interjects Anttt.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>There is us</em>, transmits Antttt.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>There is only all of us.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>We have all felt this. </em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>We have all felt this.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>We have all felt this. </em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>We have all felt this</em>. The message turns in her mind, and thus in the others’ minds, and again in her own. It is a maddening cycle, like the words of the human song. And yet she is calmed by its repetition,&nbsp;the words become the rhythm that they click their soundless tarsal claws to en route to deliver gifts to their queen.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can be an <em>anyman</em> on Rancho Manteca, any single body you want to inhabit is yours. The biker sludge and the sidewalk trash, the rootin’ tootin’ phantoms of boyhoods past. You can be the beefcake. You can be the smoosh. On Rancho Manteca life’s an all out brawl.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Marshall knew what he was up for when he got the mailer. Knew what Ken was offering up for the sort of weekend meeting he wasn’t really allowed to miss without a major friend fight. He didn’t want to fight with Ken. They’re both freshly out of relationships that separated them for a long time, stuck a spike in their regular patterns. Ken said something like, “I need this.” Marshall said he’d meet him there on the second night.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There’s a big man behind the counter in a small shirt. Hairy tummy peeks between large buckle and white tee. Big man hands Marshall the room key. Big man says, “Enjoy it.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The closet is full of tropes, anymen stuff, the warrior, the gladiator, the street punk, the elegant mister, the ancient monk. Marshall changes from his clothes to clothes that are like his clothes. He’s wearing a t-shirt and blue jeans. He puts on a t-shirt and black jeans. There’s a hole in the knee. He’s never had a hole in his jeans. Then he sees the jacket. Big. Black. Leather. Moto. Marshall slides an arm in, then the other. He turns to an adjacent mirror. He looks immensely powerful.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the bathroom at Rancho Manteca’s room thirty-three Marshall runs fingers full of pomade through his hair. He’s never used pomade. He likes the waxy thickness on his hands. He can feel his dark curls twist around his fingers as he claws them back. He pats his leather chest, and as if dreaming it into fruition, feels a slender object. He removes a wood comb from the jacket’s inner pocket and runs it through his hair. That’s so fucking Boss he thinks. “So fucking Boss,” he says to his reflection. He instantly grows a moustache and high fives his reflection while a guitar solo blasts off at an alarmingly high volume.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Marshall struts around Rancho Manteca, acclimating to his moustache. He likes to twist the end. He remembers the movie with Alex P. Keaton as the basketball playing teenage werewolf and wants to surf on a van. He grows wolf hair and runs and jumps super high onto a passing cargo van. The van is going pretty fast, but Marshall’s wolf paws have claws. He grips through the metal surface, sees a kid up ahead with a boombox. He leans down while the vehicle passes the paperboy. Marshall snatches the boombox. He snaps his wolf fingers and the Beach Boys’ “I Get Around” blasts.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Marshall wants to have some wolf sex. He goes to the only leather bar in Rancho and finds a really hard mister, dressed as a really soft rocker. He’s got a rat tail for hair and a peach fuzz blonde moustache. They kiss tongues only as a way to say hello. They grab cocks and then they go to the photobooth. Marshall stops being a wolf in the booth. Demme is the guy’s name. They french like mad. A bar fight starts as Demme climbs on Marshall. Their quick sex is masked in screams from outside the booth. Screams and broken stools.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Marshall emerges from the booth, he needs to find Ken, make sure he’s having a good time. He squeezes his pecs and his chest muscles engorge, rip through his shirt and leather jacket. His moustache is greeted by a beard. Shirtless-total-beefcake Marshall makes hammers of his fists and fights back the crowd. Then, almost forgetting what brought him to the bar in the first place, he punches his way back to the booth for Demme.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You can be anyone here,” he tells Demme. He throws him over his shoulder, carries him out of the bar.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They take a lasso class. They’re told not to ever call the rope a lasso. It’s a rope. The knot is a honda. The rope passes through the honda to form a loop. They cast their ropes at targets. They throw their rope around a little calf. They talk about that movie with Billy Crystal where everyone is close to divorce on ranch vacation with ice cream makers. Demme ropes Marshall. They head back to Marshall’s room and Marshall turns back to his normal shape. Demme turns back to his normal shape too. When Marshall turns around to look at his normal shape, Demme is Ken. Marshall hoped Demme was Ken. He was thinking if Demme was Ken he’d shape his whole life around him and squeeze.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Was to a holiday party. They ran across my torso, in sets of two. I liked to think of them in sets of two, when I did my mirror dance. I did my mirror dance as practice. Practice for Bethany Ethel Miggs. I knew Bethany Ethel would be at the party. I knew her face would see my face and her eyes would see these stripes, so I wanted to be sure they looked right when I danced. The sweater folded over at the bottom ‘cause I’m "skin and bones," is what my mom says. So the stripes were loose and the fold was thick, which gave me a little more body than usual.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I showed up. I drank from the punch bowl in a red cup. We all had the red cups. And I clocked my neck around the room counting them. Everyone’s hand wrapped around one. Every hand must have also wrapped around the glass ladle from the punch bowl to pour the punch. Every hand had two things in common.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She wasn’t there. Bethany Ethel was nowhere to be found. I thought a lot about my diet then, because my stomach sank and I wasn’t sure if it was due to the string cheese I ate before I got here, or the hard cheese I ate once I was here, or the punch I’ve had at least two too many of, or whether it was Bethany Ethel herself. Her absence. I wanted to cry when I thought of it, all the mirror dancing prep, this stupid striped sweater. I should have worn blue shirt or white shirt or white and blue shirt. Really any old favorite would have saved me from the sink I was in. The sinking feeling. Like the gymnasium floorboards with their high sheen squeak was giving in under me, like I’d soon be under it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I had to go outside. I gripped my red cup tight as I darted to the doors. The bright light blinded me and I was without my jacket in the cold. It was still snowing as I refocused on the outside. Fresh snow over everything. The parking lot wasn’t melting it away either. There were tire tracks moving in circles overlapping other tracks like the cars were on spyrographs, like big hands led them around from high above, like our world was built and we were marionettes. I heard a tussling noise then from around the tan bricks of the tall gym.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A couple of guys were swarming around her. Swarming around Bethany Ethel Miggs. She was repeating the words "stop" and "don’t."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Hey!” I yelled.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Some of the boys looked around and said, “Screw off, Jerk.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No way,” I said and I walked towards them, ditching my red cup.&nbsp;Like a finger snap they started to scatter off. I felt immensely powerful until a huffing sound startled me (almost to death) and a big guy came running from behind me after the boys.&nbsp;It was Barry Miggs, Bethany’s kid brother, the size of two of any of the clowns messing with Bethany.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So then Bethany Ethel was left alone. I told her she looked cold. I said, “here, get in,” and I lifted my big sweater over her head and slid her head against my chest, but the neck hole was not big enough for her head to get through the sweater with me still in it. She was struggling, and I realized this was sort of a strange move. So I slid out, using a dip maneuver I practiced in the mirror when I was dancing. I knocked my head into hers before passing her body on my way out, exchanging my place in the sweater for hers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I only wore a tank top underneath the sweater. I said, “I’d better run in and get my coat.” Bethany looked me up and down.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Hey," she said, "what’s your name again?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"Oh, I’m Vincent. We take -”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Algebra,” she interrupted. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah,” I said, “that.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well, thanks Vince,” she said, “I’ll bring it back. Doesn't fit me either."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Last time I wore stripes so did Bethany Ethel Miggs. She called me Vince in a snowstorm when I was punch drunk and I’ve never worn them since because I framed the sweater in a plastic hanging sleeve to show her someday when we’re together forever.</p>

He is happy, as he says, “to make drive.” You can imagine him, leathery skin, navy pinstripe blazer, slicked back curls, smiling, jutting his nose over the wheel, a kid on a cart. He’s happy <em>always</em> to do this driving, zooming around making rights from far left lanes, pointing at the horse statues, speaking to foreign passengers, like the couple he is dropping off, about the discovery of this place, how they came on horseback, how the natives were found, how this land presented itself to them. “Cavaleiros,” he shouts. His passengers thinks he is calling out the horses, as they duck into a tunnel under the park, and head to their rental.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Danielle is the Señorita that works the front desk of the Doctor’s building. “Unmarried,” she clarifies, while pointing to “Priscilla,” while saying, “Señora, <em>married</em>.” and winking at the Doctor, past the couple checking into their rented room. These are the passengers from Hicardo’s car. Hicardo sits outside chatting with a doorman named Ugo, his white teeth shining as he smacks the lanky boy’s shoulder with a cackle that makes the couple turn and awkwardly wave. He’s waiting for the Doctor, but they tell themselves he must talk to everyone here.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Doctor is greeted with great warmth from HIcardo. She puts a busy finger up and says, “Um momento, ‘Cardo.” She skitters across the street to the cafe.The regulars bustle in and out in waves. The old man, Señor Flormá, taps his cane in the corner, his hat hung low over his brow, his jacket too heavy for this warmth. Raul, the barista, foams milk behind the corner. Margarita plays dominoes with her daughter. Ooga, behind the counter with Raul smiles brightly at the Doctor who orders a cafe for herself, pauses, and orders a second for Hicardo.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Leonardo is down the way, fumbling his big thumbs over colorful buttons at the phone store’s printer. The Doctor visits him here to refresh her card, she has Hicardo wait for this errand. He fumbles the whole way through the Doctor’s order, his brow sweating as he fidgets, his white shirt hanging over his waistband like a lab coat. There is never enough time for Leonardo. He always feels like another customer is waiting. Though there often is, they are not putting the pressure on Leonardo the way Leonardo puts the pressure on Leonardo.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Doctor is looking for a school for her daughter. Hicardo drives her to and from. His cost is less than the time it would take her to go by almost any other mode. Plus, his company is a delight when she feels like paying attention. He waits for her outside every building she visits,. She watches Hicardo in the reflection of a screen above the scanner as Leonardo sweats behind the desk. He thumbs his way over a single piece of paper smoothing the barcode which is split from where he tore the SIM card out - he’s trying to repair the code to scan it. She leaves the phone store with a fresh chip, sees the couple up on a balcony in her building, looking out at a city they’ve probably never seen before. She wonders how they see it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Doctor thinks of Italy, of the coast where she once lived, about the day she arrived back here, and bought an apartment in that building, after many years away, about swept away favelas that have spawned skyscrapers in their place, about now living atop those old shacks. She sees twins in a double stroller, under matched red awnings, clawing at the air around them. The babies here are babies. <em>Babies are babies everywhere</em>, she thinks. Both their faces look like the mushy faces of so many other babies, like the faces that come in and out of her office opening their mouths to her candy-coated throat cultures. And yet her hand meets her chest as the twins pass, grateful to see the town still growing. She smiles at the lady pushing them, but she does not see the Doctor’s admiring glance.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Doctor could be anyone, an average passerby. The man in the phone store that she knows is Leonardo could merely be a shadow, a blur, a body past the glass and the flat screen televisions. She thinks as she looks up at this couple, <em>the road and the street signs and the many motorcycles going past the odd shaped cars do not exist, are all invisible, unless you see them too</em>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For them the day might see a dozen other people, on another road, in another place, opening the town up slowly, allowing its secrets to unfold, welcoming them into its story. Or maybe what they see and know is a tale in a book that she will never open, that she heard something about and then purchased to read, though it sits on a shelf in the building there at the far edge of the street where she lives, collecting dust. She’ll pull something off the shelf when she is home, open up to a place she’s never been, imagine herself and her husband and their daughter on a balcony someplace, looking out at the townspeople.</p>

      <title>Rodeo Ridealong</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2018/1/24/rodeo-ridealong</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Canon Powers sits on a haystack in a truck bed pulled by an ancient Ford pickup on the bumpy road to the show. He looks at his peers - all brimming with curiosity and anticipation, gripping handfuls of hay beneath them. Most are new to the ridealong. Some have been and fallen. Some past victors remain. Two are too old. Canon is unfazed by the group. He pictures the animals in his head. Bull, Horse, calf, mutton. He feels their different coats against his fingertips. He rubs his thighs, his tiny calfskin chaps.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Canon is the calm center of the bustling cart, he’s determined, immersed in thought - about the event, about the future. He ties a honda in his head. Overhand knot. Press the base. Pull the tail through. Tighten. Pass your noose through your honda and your lariat is gold. He repeats the steps in his head. The children pull clumps of hay.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is his second rodeo of the year. There will be a third come fall. By December, he’ll be mutt busting, and then, he’ll ride. His parents have grown accustomed to finding him sitting upright in bed when they open his door each morning. He looks at them as they would business associates - those who contain permissions to getting things moving.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">His patience disturbs mom. She mistakes his fortitude for joylessness. Dad is off-put by his son’s abundant self control. He’s watched cousins lasso their youth as they flail and whine. When free to roam Canon simply makes his way to the stockyard and stable where he silently converses with the livestock. They’ll come to know his intentions and provide a clear path.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Many parents greet the children at the gates before they make their entrance. Tonight Canon calmly requested that his, just wait, and watch for me. His small voice, although infrequently utilized, is unwavering. When he speaks eye contact is only broken upon acknowledgment that his point’s been heard.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of the new boys in the hay cries out in a fit. Canon closes his eyes and imagines the crowd. He crouches low on his steed and imagines the barrel race. He pictures the animal’s perfect stride beneath him, the speed through the gate and the swift turns. He pictures his knots again, the steer, the chase, the tackle. He flexes his tiny arms, barely able to contain the knowing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Canon is three years old. He sees the night unfold in his mind. This is the last time he’s restricted to the ridealong and roundup that follows. Upon arrival at the rodeo he will remember his age - a thorn in his gut. Upon release from the gate, he and forty other screaming toddlers will run after three loose sheep. Canon will take down the first within thirty seconds, a full minute and a half before the third is tackled by a girl twice his size. He’ll be given a tiny trophy, and look on as the four-to-eights gather their helmets and mount their mutts.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Little does Canon know the prophetic nature of his visions. Life will continue to unfold exactly as he sees it. Come December he will Mutt-bust and stay atop the woolly thing longer than any peer. He will ride well from the start. He will tame wild stallions without effort or struggle. He will break rules and records. He will say what he means. He will die young, and in love, and the world will hear it.</p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah, so he’s not a magician anymore.” The bigger man looks at your sketchbook, at the yellow tooth man with the snake emerging from his chest you’ve drawn. “Your guy doesn’t scream scary,” he says. “He definitely screams something, like woah, he <em>is</em> screaming, but he’s not exactly striking fear.” The man you've drawn has his foot on a diamond and has a third eye over his crotch. "The crotch eye thing is problematic -"</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Right, so we’re moving this to the mountains.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh right, to like India or something.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"So still," he makes an air quote with two fingers, "dark arts."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"But, now more - Eastern."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We’re still using the snakes,” the little guy says tentatively, gut checking the bigger guy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The snakes are a must have,” the big guy practically shouts.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We totally want the snakes,” the little guy reiterates now, more confidently.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But think he's more in a body wrap, or robe. But, not a suit.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Because of the Nazis.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes, we don’t want him to fight Nazis anymore.” They pause, hunched over your work looking at you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“So," the little guy starts to move his hands back and forth like he's passing a basketball between them, "it’s more of a prequel now. In India. <em>Get it</em>?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You don’t get it. You must look confused to them. He fought Nazis in the first movie, but he isn’t now, but that doesn’t help you come up with who he is fighting now, or what he looks like.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Those are the notes.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The notes from the big guys.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“<em>Sorry</em>,” you interrupt the men talking. “So, what is the direction?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Lose the purple robe, and the diamond, and the magic hat.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"And the third eye."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Keep the bunny, though, that’s good for the dinner scene. They’re gonna eat so many weird things at the dinner scene.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But <em>he’s</em> not there.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Right, right, right. He’s not at the dinner scene.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“<em>Indy</em> is not at the dinner scene?” you ask, wondering who the <em>he</em> they're referring to is.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh no, the <em>villain</em>. We’re talking about the villain. You’re not coming up with Indy.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We have Indy.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Obviously we have Indy. It’s just the villain isn’t there.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"Right," you say, sort of understanding this confusion, "where is he?"</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“In his volcano or whatever.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“So… he’s sort of a dark.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We don’t want to say dark.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well he’s not pale.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No. Not pale. You’ve gone too pale here.” He circles your drawing's hands and face to indicate these are the areas in which you've gone<em> too pale. </em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“He’s Indian.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We can say Indian.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“He’s like a fiery god.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“He rips hearts out of chests.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It is awesome!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"Very cool the way he takes hearts."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“So maybe he’s in a robe, but like a skirt, like with his chest exposed.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And fiery eyes.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah, and a head wrap or something.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes, a head wrap or something.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Can you see him?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You cannot. “I’m just a little confused,” you say. "So, before he fought Nazis and was an archeologist and now he’s fighting a volcano god?"</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh, this is a prequel, it’s before the Nazis. But, yeah, he’s still in search of an artifact.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah, he’s still an artifact hunter. There's a whole thing about artifacts.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Just, that now… he’s helping a village of kids out of slavery from our volcano guy.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah, like from an underground temple of dread.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“<em>That</em> is probably what we’ll call it.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Sounds awesome, right? Underground Temple of Dread."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Can you have it to us by Thursday?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">"Thursday would be great."</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They stare at you waiting. You realize the meeting is over. You look at what you’ve drawn, and you think of what they’ve asked for. You stand and say, “Sure, heart stealing fire god. Got it.” Because what else are you going to say. This is your big break.</p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What you gonna do with it, Rascal? You gonna eat it? It’s a pretty big meat. For a fella used to a alley scrap, that’s a white whale. Where’d you catch her? By them docks? You swoop her up with a claw snatch? I don’t see no claw scratch on ‘em. Looks a clean and fresh though. Little scared too. What’d ya say you was gonna do? Her’s fresh. A beast of a feast. You can prolly spend a week. By midway her’d be nice and rot-filled like you’re used ta. Maybe you can split it up amongst you and the rest. One big meat to eat in a single sit down.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There’s a burger joint round the alley you crawled outta this morning. Same spot where them same everyday scraps fill your rascal plate. You’ve got a mouth full now. Yous'll be king for a day. You ain’t used to going fish. You ain't used to a handful to carry. You like to be quick on them feets. Maybe that’s why ya scared. I see you, Rascal. I can smell the fear on you past the stink of that beast you hold up in between them claws.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I could help you, maybees. Maybees, we could strike a meal. <em>Whoops</em>. We can, you and me, we can writes up a contract, saying something like, tail and flippers for me, gut and eyes for you, and the bones we count up and split nice and even-steven.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>What’s in it for you?</em> Every little thing’s in it for you, Rascal. You splits ‘em with me and we’s the only two who has to know. We splits and the whole fish is ours. It can be romantic. Maybe I got a match. Maybe I got a candle, and a quiet place.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You like that, Rascal? If I has a little quiet place, away from the alley cats and scrappers, away from all them ordinary Rascals who ain't so smart as to catch a fish like this? I got such a place. I founds it. My little water tower hotel. Chased some alley cats out, and made it mines. We can share my bed for sleeps. There’s a hole in the top wheres we can peep the stars up and out. They got little shards a glass in the tower walls, make the moonlight flicker through in all colors. You wanna see it? We could be Rascals together. Even if you ain’t had the fish, we could. But the beast ain’t hurtin’ our chances neither.</p>

You need to invite them. I need you to invite them. I know you don’t know how. But it’s very simple. There’s money in it. It shames me to tell you this. I also consider myself a deeply moral person. You should know that. I need you to know your grandparents aren’t going to know your motivation is money.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Well, maybe they will know. They raised me. I’m dangling this in front of you. Maybe they’re dangling it in my subconscious. Maybe they’re telling me to tell you, it’s ok, there’s money to be made here, off the ones that came before, off of the tradition of where money comes from. Maybe they’ve already told me all of this. It comes from the places, the mouths of the people, that tell you where it doesn’t come from: trees, lethargy, ungardened gardens.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You have to write them and tell them that you want them to be where you will be on the day of your graduation. They are already expecting it, this invitation. They’re inwardly demanding it, have been, since the moment you slid into this world, onto their lap, off the slide, into a locker. You are theirs, you see, as you are mine, and you are yours. But they are yours too, as I am yours and you are yours. We all share these commonalities, we’re on this ship, yes, this metaphoric vessel, this dwelling place where we traverse the seas that quake and shake things up in our individual and collected experiences. You have to write them,&nbsp;old fashioned, with a pen to paper, to make them know you’ve taken the time to dot and cross the t’s and i’s.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Give me your hand. Let me show you something physical. I can’t believe you’ve never done this. First take a blank white envelope. This is the holding place that brings your request from them to you. I know you’ve seen it, handled it. This is how it was done. Always. Forever, passed between people to people. This is it. Fill it. Place that which you’ve written into the envelope and seal it. Yes, with your tongue. But not the whole of your tongue. Just lightly dab it, dab it just along the dried paste. When you moisten the paste it reanimates as adhesive. So, you’ve only got one shot. Once you’ve licked it and it dries you won’t have another chance at this.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So take it and dab it and seal it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This paper has their address. No, it goes in the center, and it should be larger than your address. Yes, your address also goes on the envelope. So there’s a place to return the letter should it be lost. No, they aren’t going to send the letter back. The address is in case the carrier has a reason to return it, in case your grandparents have moved. &nbsp;No, they haven’t moved. But, yes, you still need the address - in case something goes wrong. What can go wrong? Anything can go wrong. Everything often does. You know this.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dogs can go wrong. Snow can go wrong. A letter can get wet and the ink may confuse the words and thus the direction of the envelope. Maybe the envelope ends up with someone who denies it. Maybe it has to find you again because a number you’ve written is illegible. Maybe there are new addresses that we didn’t know about when we sent the letter. Maybe time has forgotten all things as I have forgotten to show you this very basic thing: your address, at the top of an envelope. Jesus, what a fool I am.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You are not a fool. I have definitely not shown you enough. We paid extra for fancy kindergarten and now I have to teach you about primal technology. Technology before technology. Volcanic ash on walls. This isn’t your fault. It’s my own. Time certainly has caught up.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">No, not there, to the left, like in a letter. Yes, you also put it to the left in the letter so people know who is responsible for the message below the greeting. The greeting is the Dear Whoever, part. They’ll be expecting that as well. &nbsp;You haven’t written the letter? You’ve never written a letter? Surely we must have talked this through. An email is like a letter. A letter has more rules. No, they will not respond to an email. It has to be this way. You start with Dear and then the name, in this case: Grandma &amp; Grandpa. That’s an ampersand. It’s the same as saying and.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What's that? Is that an email from mom? My mom? No. That can’t be right. They don’t know anything about this modern.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Oh. I see. They’ve sent me an email as well. Yes, there are lots of ways to make money. Yes, I see. You can go.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She laid her mask out on the tarp delicately before they arrived home. This was after she painted it with all the pretty features one might expect from a mask. She rouged its cheeks, made the lips into a heart shaped kiss, arranged its teeth in an agreeable pattern. Normally, the lids over the eyes were at half tilt, the eyes underneath alert and seductive, a fixed flirtation. When she bowed they would see her half lids, when she rose they’d see her come-hither invitation. This feature she altered. On this day the eyes were alert, the brows were arranged on a minute tilt, furrowed, angry.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The tarp she laid her mask atop was in the living room, to watch over them as they drank, though it looked out at the city below, away from the men. She would attend them unadorned, with her true face, her waking face. She would face them, this last day of their lives. No one needs to cover a blemish when a blemish is no longer yours to name.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The men would start early, their wives tucked away on their permanent weekend vacations. She set a tray in plain site with the first two glasses heavily poured. This allowed her the time she needed to prepare. Her mask sat on the floor atop the tarp which sat below the table, the couch, the chairs. They’d mistake it for a remodel, if they ever looked down at all.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They did as she assumed they would, loudly entered, clumsily knocking a thing to the floor, possibly a rack, or an entire table. They laughed and they spit, they chewed while they talked. She could picture the bloat in their bellies, and the rounds of their cheeks, the delight they shared in each other’s private company, to outwit all that were out of earshot, to think their game an endless folly.&nbsp;They didn’t take their shoes off when they entered as they were supposed to, would never notice the slick surface that sat above the typically soft rug.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When she heard the first grumble she arranged the poison behind her. She wanted to pour it before them, at their feet, she wanted her secret to enter the room with her. She liked the risk in getting caught, which is why she tucked the blade behind her naked back when she entered the room. What distractible beasts they were at the site of her body uncovered, how simply they could forgive every change in routine. She did not greet them, yet here she was already undressed. She did not pour the first drink, yet here was another round between two breasts. The dinner was not set, yet the cheese plate laid half eaten. Her face was quite different, but neither could trace their finger and find its past.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She poured for the men, who continued to banter, each darting their eyes from one another to her chest. The head of the house reached for a handful of breast and the woman rolled her shoulder to avoid his grasp.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Patience sir,” she spoke as she revealed the poison in its clear beaker, “I’ve brought you both a gift.” A grunt was the man’s response, he tilted back and quickly emptied his cup, offered it back to her to refill with a nod. The woman leaned over to turn the mask on the floor to face the men as well.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Wait," bellowed the master. "What is different about you, girl?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Enjoy my gifts,” she responded, straightening her posture to dart her chest forward as she backed away.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She poured herself a cup from the finest bottle in his cabinet.&nbsp;There was a cough from the living room, then the sound of gagging, and though she would have liked to be the last thing they saw, it was fitting that they’d look to each other, helpless giants, each a lifetime away from any craft or skill, each a moment away from whatever cruel eternity awaited them.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As quickly as it takes to pour another drink, toast another year, as quickly as a building is leveled into dust, or a sleeping body is stepped over on a busy street, they slumped over off their seats and released their bowels. It is not a subtle gesture to end a life, not a simple change in look and demeanor. It is a deep breath, followed by a knife plunge, the blade pushed through skin, then bone, then organ, then through bone and skin again. It is the sound accompanied by the blood that a body omits in its final gasp. It is an exhale that feels like redemption, that does not ask for forgiveness, that rejoins a stolen body to the body’s spiritual owner. A moment to rejoice, if only a moment.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Of course she hoped they’d see her mask, angry and scowling, sitting on the floor as they toppled atop the tarp below. Of course she had many hopes, but as soon as she counted both thuds, she only could look at her own wrists, at her own hands, of all the things she could now lift herself up and out from. She made her way to the ornate vivarium, lifted the glass doors to release the snakes who devoured the men in two solid gulps. What fools they were to keep such beautiful creatures as pets.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You’ve felt a warming for months. The cream walls look peach to you. The shower water cannot cool enough. The best you can get is room temperature from pulling the knob all the way to C. You keep ice buckets beside the trays in your freezer to stockpile. You keep all your liquids in the refrigerator door. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You used to slide your hands into rice when you were young. You used to bury your hands in sand still wet from higher tides. You’d sit for hours submerged, thinking of the lives of the crabs that are charting paths around your fingers. You’d let mountains crumble off your knuckles as you unearthed and raised your hands, always sad to know that you’d eventually leave the beach, that the sun would blast through the cloud coverage and heat the cool spot you’d found.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lately your clothes do not fit. You stretch and pull them over your body, everything feels like an unwanted embrace. You don’t want to be held down. Work keeps you tethered to a timeline. You arrive barely on time. You leave a minute too late, always finding the doors closing on your train, always staring at rats on the tracks, slipping in between old wrappers and used tissues. They must have it good down there, in constant cool dark. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>How does one leave a life?</em> You write in script in a notebook from a past relationship. He’d given you the thing, wide lines within it, yellow and orange butterflies on the cover flying over light blue outlines of illustrated New York City landmarks. Cool and Warm. Blue and Yellow. His name was Sam. Hirsute Sam. His knuckles were dark with hair. You used to imagine him slipping out during full moons. You used to picture him tearing tendons from a bone. You imagined him tracing your spine with sharp claws before sinking his teeth in between the base of your neck and your shoulder. He would have delicately moved your hair to clear the way for his meal, and the delicate way he would have done it would have ruined the whole thing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When you were young there was a cave very far from this city. Bad stories surrounded it about bad things that happened within it, and bad spirits that lived on. You used to spend whole days there. Kids out looking for a scare would turn a corner and there you’d be, reading by the lantern, under a blanket. All you had to do was acknowledge them and they’d run screaming.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You could just slip out. You could disappear, leave the keys on the kitchen table and leave the window cracked the way it always is. You’d take the fire escape. You’d adjust your dress to any pervert eyes below. You’d leave everything as it is. You’d leave no note, no explanation, you’d simply vanish. When they came looking for the body, after months of mail deliveries and missing rent checks, they wouldn’t find a bad odor or unpleasant smell. They’d find a perfectly clean place that is too warm in the winter and too warm in the summer. They’d find the small vague signs of paths that you traveled and places you’ve been. They’d find the outline of your life.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dennis ate the fences. He gnawed the posts from their Own trenches. His barbed wire dreams turned to nightmares as the metal cut his mouth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He ordered toothpicks that were useless. As all he had to pick with were his hooves and, when he stopped to think about it it was gauze and Novocain that he would choose fit.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He took to drinking lots of liquid that rotted out his system. He chewed worms for soft nutrition but it led to indigestion. Headaches replaced his thinking as he wandered through his building.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Dennis,” called a stranger, “why are you so angry?” He turned to find an empty seat across the conference table. He’d been working late to cover up the shifts when he was too embarrassed to show his face because of the aforementioned cuts, the mouth scrapes, the body aches.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alone in the boardroom on the twenty seventh floor Dennis chewed through the QR reports and made a bed to ease his soars. He slept as comfortably as a beast away from home. The carpet was industrial, a nice thing to scratch against his bones.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dennis had a dream that night of a delicious fire hose. The way the canvas was tough to chew left him excited, so he rose. While still sleeping he clomped his hooves towards a glass box near the water closets. And when he woke he was soaking wet, the roof was like a faucet.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He left his job. He left the city. He left his life. 'Twas quite a pity. Then walking along route sixty-six he saw a sign, like it was all his. The sign advertised a ball of twine thirty feet tall and thirty feet wide. Dennis started in and in a week he'd eaten the whole sign. He clipped its legs, and fell it down, he worked all hours and he gulped it down. And now he's thirsty.</p>

      <title>Let's Talk About Worms</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2018/3/27/lets-talk-about-worms</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">These things are simply everywhere. Land-worms, space-worms, delicious delicacies of the dark oceans and high peaks. Every planet has thousands of species. Every species is a treat. There are Nareworms, combworms, nutworms, meatworms, inside-outers, sluglusts, sandscrapers, anglechains, gurgle-fins, and glorm-glorms. Speller-worms are known to form letters or symbols to communicate familiar messages to their prey. Sharp-stripers are worms dressed in stripes with mouths like an anus and teeth like a cham-cham.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What doesn’t a worm make? These industrious little beasts are known across the galaxies for their resilient colonies, their odd shapes, and for their affection for flexi-straws and deathly-strong beverages. A worm loves something rotten as much as a worm likes something distilled. Their bars are the best to frequent, if one is lucky enough to fit within them, and not small enough to become food for the ever-present wormies. The saying goes, if a worm is close, so is a bar, and if a worm-bar is close, there goes your eyes. It is not a good saying, but it is said.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Worms drink, well, like worms! There’s no end to their limit. If they get too drunk, they excrete. Then they drink the excretion. One may stumble upon a well fed worm, drunk on rot, and squeeze the thing for all it’s got. Delicious. That is, of course, if it hasn’t been feasted on already.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Worm bars are like a factory of arpeggiated delight. A conveyor belt runs lengthwise over top of the bartop. The belt easily moves glasses from one worm to the next. The glasses are affixed to the belt. A hose system underneath the bar applies an almost worthless rinse to the glassware once it makes its way to the underbelly. A pump at the far side of the conveyor belt releases a glass worth of liquid rot into a passing glass, the system runs like clockwork.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The worms twist their bodies upright on cylindrical stools. All stools have the thick treads of a carpenter screw so that worms of all sizes can worm their way up to perch. The worms approach each glass by fixing their mouth to a flexi - straw. Each worm dips their straw into the next passing glass of drink on the belty. The passing glass gives a passing worm a chance to sip. The belt moves. Next glass. Another sip. And so on. Of course, worms have no issues with sharing glasses or straws as jealousy or fear or pride or germaphobia are far too complicated feelings for worms to indulge in. They know of hunger. They know of thirst. They very much like being drunk on rot.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The belt-bar was designed by Doctor Worm, who had a propensity for drumming, when not face down in his own drink. Doctor Worm was not a real Doctor, but he was an actual worm. The conveyor-belt bar system altered all of wormkind, across the universe. The flowing distribution of alcohol seemed even and never ending, and it made these industrious little beasts stick to perfect schedules. They drink when they’re done eating. They eat when they’re done digging. They dig when they’re done sleeping. They sleep when they’re done drinking. The cycle repeats.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They rage through the night, listening to disco - pulsating rhythm that entrances them into sheerly happy beings. They sip their straws and cross pollinate publicly, fertilizing the earth around them and one another. It’s all quite a vibrant scene. Loud music. Unintelligible conversation. Smiling worm faces. Ghostly worm eyes. They knock into one another. They twist themselves into knots. The population probably doubles. The disco reigns. There goes your eyes.</p>

      <title>Brazilian Batman</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2018/4/18/brazilian-batman</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Two year old Tom, in his best batman cowl and cape, on a playground speaking Portuguese. Two year old Penny with puppets, crying, cradling as many felt figures as she can handle in her hands. She doesn’t speak the language here, a slide is not a slide. I wonder, does this Brazilian boy already love her, as he tends to her falling flock? With each doll drop, the crying increases, and Batman is there to quietly right the fallen wrongs. I want to pick up Tom, and put him back in Penny’s arms.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want to tell you about my can. It’s a little one. A pequeño. It’s not even a regular soda’s size. It’s even smaller. It’s a wonderful can. I place two shoes inside it, the kind that you can roll up, one zipper style raincoat hoodie, a spare pair of underwear, two unused undershirts, and two plastic socks. My can has two dents in it. This is from when a bozo tried to take it from me. I held it so tight to my chest I nearly crushed the thing, making the dents. Good news is they’re my dents and not the bozo’s. He didn’t even leave a mark. When I was a boy the can was given to me. I was told to protect it. To carry it around on a string from my neck. I was told it was magic.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A clown of a man once tried to ridicule me and my can. He shouted and spit. He tried to make a fool of me on a city street. Before I’d cleared the crosswalk, just before I reached the curb I lifted the string that my can swings from over my head and looped it round my hand. I spun my can in a furious helicopter motion and started running towards the clown screaming, “my can is powerful, my can is my guardian, my can is my friend.” I could see the clown’s eyes grow wide, the way fear creeps into an unsuspecting face because what I was doing threatened him, and was maybe a little strange. He closed his clown mouth. He waved his clown hands in their stupid white gloves up at me, the sign for “stop,” and “please,” and “don’t.” I got real close to him and stopped spinning my can. When my mouth was very near his ear I whispered, “it is a very good can, my can. Wouldn’t you agree?” The clown nodded his clown head once and I walked away.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I won my suit at the renaissance fair it was thanks to my can. The man who ran the bottle toss bet me I couldn’t land my can over the neck of one of his bottles. He sized my can up before he bet me, was sure it was smaller than one of his plastic rings. He had an unshaven face and an unfriendly painted brow. He’d made himself look like a threat. I accepted his offer by supplying my terms. I told him, “if I land my can around the neck of your green bottle than the business suit worth 150,000 tickets will be mine.” The man of course laughed. The business suit was known to be unwinnable. To the visitors of the fair it had never, in fact, been eligible for winning. But no one had ever had a can like mine. I spun it in a helicopter motion, I let it go while keeping hold of the string and I landed it right over the neck of this man’s green glass bottle. I pointed to the suit and the stunned man handed it over. As I held my pointer finger out the man rested the hanger’s hook over it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Thank you for my suit,” I whispered to my can. Then I made the satisfied face a cat makes when it purrs, I slowly blinked my eyes at the man, lifting the string over my head and resting my can against my chest.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My can and my suit are my assets as I am theirs. I take them for walks and show them our world. All the while they hold me in and let me out. I am never alone because one is always embracing me while the other is softly kneading my heart.</p>

      <title>A Morning Visit</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2018/5/9/a-morning-visit</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The clumsy fluttering of a flock of cherubim wakes you, their wings battling gravity to keep their pudgy baby bodies afloat. They fill the room with the scent of fabric softener, wafts of lavender puffed with each bat of those tiny wings. It is time to wake up. If you wait too long they’ll move on and you’ll miss the delightful parade of their daily chores. They’d never wake you if you were still asleep, and they have so many other rooms to visit at the hotel.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You roll out of bed and dash to the closet seeking cover to watch. Two make the bed. They struggle pushing the comforter to the floor, tugging and air tumbling while they roll the thing off the mattress. Then they locate the corners of the top sheet, your favorite part, they each lift a corner, the sheet’s wrinkles fade to form a bulbous shape which parachutes down against the bed. Then the smallest cherub darts at the center of the bubble and bounces into the center of the mattress, the sheet ripples flat.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Up on a perch above the window molding sits the elder, plucking the strings of his harp giving the three other angels a soundtrack to go about fluffing pillows, struggling to lift and pull the comforter back atop the bed, tumbling into the gentle roll of their baby bodies, giggling while they fumble with all the too large objects.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You’d like to watch them all day. You’d like to squeeze one of them, confusing them for children, confusing them as objects that may want to be squeezed. But you musn’t let them know you’re here. You must enjoy their mysterious ways in secret, for this is just a daily chore to them, a job, the way that your job is a job. You think what it would be like to have someone lurking behind you as you sit in front of the typewriter, as you place files into folders, and folders into binders, and place binders on shelves in long rows of green, accounting, and blue, contract, and burgundy, archives.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You imagine the babies lifting the binders for you as you pluck the harp. You imagine the cold and small windowed room of the file library afloat in the clouds, with white puffs of air as shelves and the tiny babies everywhere, always fluttering, giggling, poking one another in the tummy. What you cannot imagine is that they have their problems too, that when they put on their masks and play war the world turns into a fiery hellscape.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What you cannot imagine is what’s at stake between their rounds, the poisoned wells of their cloud villages, the mischievous gods of the sea, and the cruel mysteries of the earth. On their days off, when they’ve had too much time on their hands they spear the innocent and the harp strings plucked are to the tune of vengeance against the demons that have wronged them. Best to keep quiet in the closet. Best not to cross them, best to lay still and allow some things to take their natural course.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is what you’ll look like. After high school. After the parade. This is the expression that your face will make in its resting phase. A smirk but never a smile, a clenched jaw beneath the skin. These little dots are you never clean shaven. You’ll never grow a beard, will never fill the face in. You threw your last ball twenty years ago, Carson. But you’re still in a ringer tee. Your whole scene is yellow.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That last line sounds like a send off. Like my whole life will be a wash out. As of late I draw a lot of lines to claim the time I need to get things done. Yet, in the time I demand for myself nothing is ever getting done. I loop ears to the sides of the eyes on the illustration. A lot of time to fill in the lines of the receding hair, but I’d trade a lot of this time I have for less recession.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want this drawing to tell you it could be different. I thought if I showed you, Carson, we could change it. “But, it’s inner nature,” you whisper from the illustration. It’s in our nature, is what I hear. <em>It’s our inner nature</em>, I think to the drawing of myself at present, little self portrait. I wash over it with a heavy stroke of yellow. Over everything. Watercolor bleeds across the page.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yellow is primary,” the illustration whispers. <em>Whispers my present self</em>. He is me now. The way I see myself: a half stance, an indecision king. “But this was meant to be about me.” Well, you are speaking to me, little one. I guess we’re in the same ship on that level. Sea level. A girl walks into a bar. You ask her how she’s been. Sea level, she replies. You could be so bold, to even know yourself enough to reply like this.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s one of only three,” says Carson, now smirking at me. “It’s not a sinking ship. It’s half of orange. Half of green.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s what you make it,” we say at the same time. I draw another line under his right eye. I shade beneath the chin.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Yellow is what you make it</em>, my younger self thinks to me.&nbsp;I am holding an oar, twenty years ago, on a boat with the backs of seven young men in front of me. When the seat glides in the shell, you bring your chest to your knees, then you plunge the oar back into the water and release, pushing with your legs away from your feet. We were above sea level. We were gliding across the surface, our backs to the future. The sun rising over the river. Color spread out and filled in everything.</p>

      <title>Quick Brown Fox</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2018/4/25/quick-brown-fox</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog, transfixed by a billboard by the highway that runs along the meadow. The lazy dog is chained to a long leash in a fenceless yard that the fox likes to frequent. The dog’s parents grow vegetables that they are often too tired to pick. Though it takes days to figure out, and weeks to relax his guard, here in this place the fox does not need to sneak to eat. He can pluck an ample something that strikes his fancy with his sharp claws and languidly make his way through it. The quick brown fox develops a taste for prolonging one bite to the next, sitting still for sometimes a minute on end, and a window opens in his brain. He begins, without sharing a word or fully comprehending it himself, to understand the lazy dog.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A karaoke machine is plugged into a power surge strip behind the quick brown fox’s chestnut tree-trunk style credenza. This is the resting place for his flat screen television. At 27 inches it fills the far wall of his cinema. Normally the fox would fancy a car chase police procedural, a jail break drama, or any heist-themed caper, but today, like most days as of late, he flicks through the channels looking for something else. He stumbles upon a sunrise with a low note being sung by a chorus of voices, and a human man, in a cowboy hat, driving in a top down convertible car, speaking to the screen. The fox stops his clicking and watches the screen.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The movie’s story is of urban growth, of suburban sprawl, of a place that feels like the past and maybe the future, like the past itself is building a future that is already past. The fox struggles to get past this idea in his head as the man again addresses the screen, the room, the fox himself. The man says, “the world is changing, buildings are changing, roads are growing wider and smaller, and less tree-lined and some with more trees.” He says, “Everything is happening at once. And everything that happens is happening today.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The fox stares at the screen immobile, confused, half-enlightened, his nimble and often restless hands limp at his sides. The movie continues but this last phrase loops while the pictures move and music swells and bursts and quiets, then disappears. The credits roll and it is not until a loud and almost cosmically offensive commercial for dish detergent wakes him from his temporary paralysis that the fox believes he understands what must change.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The fox removes his karaoke machine from his credenza, carefully unplugging and coiling the microphone cable into a neat series of circles. He hangs the instrument off a screw in his tool room and deposits the karaoke machine in the rubbish pile at the end of his driveway. In the moonlight he looks at the black box, two compact disc trays above a single speaker housed in black cross hatching, shaded blue by the night lights. He brings his paw to his lips and kisses his claw tip, lays that paw against the machine, winks, and walks back to his home.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He lays in his bed late that night, counting the glowing star stickers on the ceiling of his room, formulating his plan, building an internal order of operations, theorizing perfect patterns of traveling the many distances from where he stands to where he wishes to.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Next day, the quick brown fox purchases a sewing machine. He finds one similar to the machine his mother used when he was a cub. It will feel the most familiar to him when he begins. He places the machine in a rolling basket that he wheels to a vintage store where he purchases three blank white mechanic’s jumpsuits with pant bottoms that bell out from the shin.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He clears his tool table. He hangs each tool off a screw in the wall, then he scrubs the tabletop down with liquid soap and a hand brush. He removes new shearing scissors from his shopping bag, unpacks the sewing kit, hangs each jumpsuit off a screw. He rips the sleeves clean off at the seams on two of the jumpsuits, and clips the pantlegs at the knee from the third.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He recognizes the feeling as it surges to his claw tips, the electricity of his body’s natural pace. He is a nimble animal, he is used to working almost too quickly. He remembers the billboard and the lazy dog in the yard. “Slow down.” That’s what it said in large letters, and underneath: “Tired drivers die.” Tired drivers die had shaken him. How many months had gone by? How many days had he lived so comfortably unchased by bullets or shouts. He is meant to, is built to, outrun. He sews stitch after stitch, minor patterns in the piping, of the bright white suits. He works furiously into the night.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lightning strikes across the pasture. He hasn’t finished. His foot pulsates to a beat. He quickly darts to the kitchen to grind beans for coffee. “It’s a ten part plan, maybe fifteen,” he says aloud to the clock above the arched threshold that separates the kitchen from the dining area. The fox throws the scalding hot water over the ground beans and dashes to the table. He peddles the foot control, wishes the machine could keep up with his brain’s pattern, he can see it all, his whole life outstretched, starting with these stitches. The needle makes a pitter patter dart as the fox repeats a mumbling phrase to himself, “clothes make the man, they really can.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The quick brown fox emerges from his house, walking down the long drive to the road where the others get from one place to the next. Over his eyes are an elaborate sequined mask that sends seeds of light skittering across the pasture. A circling bird of prey watches the fox emerge in his bright white jumpsuit, casting his lights, and winds his way groundward.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Something different about you today, fox.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I am a singer. A real rock n’ roller.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Have I heard any of your songs?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No. But you will, bird. They’re coming. They’re coming fast.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“How will I know when they are here?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“This is the announcement.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And this is all you think you have to do?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No,” says the fox quite sternly. He crosses his small brown arms across his bright white chest. “You tell them you saw the Quick Brown Fox emerge from his hilltop home up there wearing a glowing white suit and a sparkling mask. You tell them his tale was wild and bright, that his teeth were sharp and his black gums glistened in the daylight. You tell them he had a message.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Wait, who am I telling?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Tell everyone. Tell them I had a message. Tell them I’m coming, bird. I’m coming quick, like me.”</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Brad swallowed a young boy on the road while we were traveling, outside the tall castle. The boy was in danger and Brad allowed him to travel by way of his stomach.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What else am I going to tell him?” Brad asks us (us being all his friends, me being one of many). “What else is a boy supposed to do, with a tail like that, stuck in a moat? My stomach is his safest passage.” The boy was the size of a salamander.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For years we’d been reenacting the renaissance at this point, so long that we were untethered to answers from the other side. What was someone to do? We gave up search engines, satellite coverage, internet browser histories, same day shipping. We traded up for old clothes, chained armor, shields, homemade ink, a butter churn.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>I need to explain it.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A brief summation: There was a choice after mass-technology became all encompassing to go back in time, or in this case over a rather crudely built wall, to a caste system. Knights, lords, ladies: that’s what people voted for, maybe they saw something sweet about chivalry and sword fights, about death-match challenges and dying en masse by flu. They took the frames off cars and made carts with tires. Horses were freed and captured and stolen back and sometimes freed again. Fires were set using rubber that burned for days.&nbsp;Big buildings fell and towns were abandoned and reclaimed. Brad was there early. He brought us all in, made the lot of us first generation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“If you adapt quickly, we can still carve a seat at the table,” Brad said. So for men short on muscles, boys really, we asked Brad, we trusted him, and he told us to get sewing, and then to get dressed, all the while we whistled tunes. He’d scribble notes for our outfits, lighten our spirits as we made them. Buster traded his guitar for a lute. I helped rewrite lyrics to pop songs, and without ever really noticing it we found an order, a way of doing things. We built oaths and rules through word games we were already familiar with. When we were short on answers we asked Brad. You could ask Brad anything. He’d answer quickly. Lightly. Easy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We were the Brotherhood of the Cross. It sounded cool, vaguely or very religious depending on what you look for in a name, and would keep us together, in this new place. We traveled in a line, we had songs which made us look established, and those of us who could grew facial hair. The group would look distinguished this way, have an authenticity here in this new land pretending to be a very old one.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our numbers were strong enough to fill an abandoned farmhouse on the outskirts of the boarded up city. We had no rooms to let, so the practice of turning large families away was unburdened. We harnessed our skills. Those not squeamish killed the first animals. Those that couldn’t bare the blood planted seeds and raked compost. We wanted for little as a group, and made our presence known in the village, hoisting our shanks and vegetables up high, and bartering for goods and services. This went on for two years.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The house sat at the highest vantage point in the valley. We were harvesting the finest crops. When they came, claiming the house was needed for more important lineages, they went to Brad. Though we were initially offered a place to stay Brad said we were too many already. He bargained for new land several counties over, and money to fund our journey. This is when we began to walk.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We called it a pilgrimage, though we stayed within the same state. We made it over a river, a mountain, several abandoned highways, and so many empty towns. We realized just how many had chosen to stay in the know, to remain over the wall. There would be days between seeing fellow travellers on the road. To us we had reached the farthest possible place, and knew too much, and we had Brad, waving us over, saying this was the way, so we left. We left microwaved popcorn and jarred coffee pre-milked and sugared, with a shelf life of weeks. We left ex-girlfriends and ex-boyfriends, photo albums, the cloud. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Of course Brad had to carry the boy. He was our leader, and who were we to question him? When we ended up on the flat raft over the wide river crossing he traversed the current. When we were too deep in the mud he stacked us atop one another to build a ladder out. He happened upon this boy while making cups of his hands and filling them with moat water, he felt responsible when the small thing looked up at him, floating between his palms. None of us were parents and none of us had partners. Brotherhoods, it turns out, are made of men, and even here and now, no one was willing to alter the old way.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With his thick tail for legs and his webbed fingers, the boy would crawl up Brad’s throat when he was hungry, pull Brad’s tongue when he was thirsty. At first, the signal of mealtime was Brad’s gag reflex. He would hold his knees and bend over, and start heaving. We all thought the boy had died and here was Brad vomiting up his soft body. But, we soon adjusted to Brad’s dry heaving and bending over. Brad’s throat relaxed to the idea of the boy’s slippery figure crawling up, leaning forward from the back of his tongue and screaming out for food. After a while it just looked like Brad was burping before the boy would appear below his dangling uvula.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We made camp most nights and Brad would wander off to gather whatever he could find in the surrounding brush or forest and we would not see him until morning. Most places where we made camp were good for animal meat, which we would set traps for and make fires to roast over. Brad was sleeping less and less, each stop took more of him away.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The child liked berries and fruits, things made up mostly of juice. If a grape were too big Brad would mash it first before the boy leapt further up his tongue to gather the bits. If a berry was too large he’d slice bits off and place them on his tongue like the eucharist.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We ask Brad less. On a clear and perfect day we are walking, he not even at the front of the line. He shouts, “water!” He is pointing off the path to an old bridge, with a river beneath it. The brotherhood stops and looks. “Let us head there, fellows.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I go to him, under the old bridge, wading thigh deep in the river, his eyes fixated on the spiraling shape his boy is making in the water. The walls are lined with graffitti, Brad’s hands are at his hips. I ask Brad, “what will you call him?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Brad looks up at me then and smiles. “You know, I hadn’t even considered that it was my job to do it. I’ll be happy to think of a name.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How could Brad have anticipated this? The constantly upset stomach from the growing boy’s twists and turns, the vomiting him up. How could Brad have known that his biology would change when he introduced this element to his system? How could Brad have known the responsibility he’d feel, the sudden unarguable connection?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we came upon this warm river we were wondering why stop now, this early in the day. Hours have passed, Brad fixated on his boy in the water. We are asking Brad “what should we do?” and “what’s next?” and “where do we go from here?” And Brad is waving his hands and closing his eyes to brush us away.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What is next?” someone shouts loud piercing through the grumbles of the brotherhood. Brad stands upright pointing at first at me, and then it is clear past me, to Colm, saying, “Follow Colm, I am staying here, near the river to watch this boy grow. He needs the berries that are all around us, it is the only place I have found where I might sleep, here, under this bridge, safe from looting and raiders, while he swims, with his belly full, and his body stretching.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Colm is now stepping in and demanding that we move on, that we must move forward, that surely our order will die here along this river.&nbsp;"This is hardly a place for us to make camp, let alone a home," Colm says. Brad has already removed his knightly wears, he is stripped down to a peasant’s cloth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“There is land where you are headed,” insists Brad, “it is promised to the brotherhood. Don’t ask me anymore. Ask Colm. And when you call to Colm, call him Brad.” I look at Colm, the group looks, though we only want to look at Brad. “Just look at Colm, as he stands there now, follow him. He will be your Brad. Ask Brad.”</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When limp, his hands hold the position of the hanging claw in the arcade, open to all the world below it. His dad called them bowling ball hands. This is the way he thinks about them all the time. When he closes his eyes he hears the pins crack against the ball strike. He wiggles his toes to the memory of the loose insides of ill fitting shoes, the smell of the leather spray, filling his nose.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He likes to bring each finger to the thumb one way and back when he counts the pins falling in his mind. He could be sitting on the bus, or standing in an aisle, or walking on the street, thinking about the break. He likes butter pecan ice cream from a cup when he’s at the alley. He likes when the top of it melts just enough to glisten. He glides the spoon upside down against his tongue to lick it clean, waiting, even in his imagination, for his next turn to move his hand over a ball and drop down to swoop it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The alley is where he goes as one would an office. But this is not his job. They have a happy hour special at the lanes grants several free hours of bowling for the purchase of just one concession. Tomorrow he'll buy a float because he can already taste the ice cream, even on the bus, even miles away. His right claw grips the leather handle above him, his left hangs open and ready and searching at his side.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He arrives and the alley is closed. This is a wrench. He would describe it as a wrench, says this aloud to the empty parking lot with its vast system of open lines holding spaces for the absent cars. <em>SYSTEM MAINTENANCE</em> reads the sign on printer paper taped to the door. With the crumpled five dollar bills in his pocket graze his thigh. He has little else to keep him occupied. He’s also out $0.35 cents in bus fare to have gotten to this disappointing moment. He’ll be out another $0.35 to get back to the picnic house, which is where he’s been spending his nights.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The picnic house has an all you can eat hamburger special for $5.99. They take a really long time to cook the hamburgers. While patrons wait the restaurant offers all the free pretzels and popcorn he wants. This is how they save on hamburgers, by filling everyone up with salted snacks. Except maybe him, salted snacks are as anticipated as the juicy burgers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When he is in the picnic house the large crowd forms a perfect noise of blank expression. Here, he closes his eyes and thinks about the way the pins will fall tomorrow. He flicks his wrist in the air, by his side. He traces the curve of the ball down the lane, a crescent meeting the center pin.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He forgets, of course, where his house is. He cannot remember where he left his keys. The keys are in a box in a bus depot. His apartment is way across town. What’s weird is the site of him knocking with both hands against the door of a blue house. It is not his house. It is in fact, no one’s house. He falls asleep on the porch swing. He wakes the next morning, cold from the dew. He checks his watch and slides off the swing, looks up at the structure he’s standing on.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“This is not your house,” he says aloud. He promptly scurries off the porch. Walking along a busy road he is reminded of a slow cooked meat, stewed until it broke apart, softly in his mouth. He is reminded of this because the smell is there, a pork smell, a stew smell. His pivots his thumb slightly to each finger so that they may touch. Back, then forth. He was born this way. Hands in claw position. He doesn’t know where he’s walking. And then he is there.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The place is empty. Maybe they are not open? But really it is the earliest he has ever come. The alley is open. He walks right in. And then a blurry movement off to the left. The Shoe man is waving him over. He’s nodding while he makes his arm wiggle. He’s bringing four fingers towards his own face like a fan. He’s mouthing the words “come over.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You’re here a lot” he says. “I could maybe use a hand,” he slowly waves his hand passing it over all the shoes stacked in rows behind him, “with the shoes.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And before our man has a chance to lift a finger and protest the shoe attendant says, “If you work here, you bowl free.” He climbs directly over the counter, positions his claws above a pair of shoes, wraps those rounded fingers around two size elevens, and places them in their slot.</p>

      <title>An Axe for Peaches Part I</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2018/5/16/an-axe-for-peaches</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“If you want to open a can of peaches, just use the axe. Talk to anybody around here about it. There’s a couple of moves you can do. Probably best to do it in private, first time. They took the can openers away, then the utensils. Left us with just the deadly objects to do routine things. I use the axes for sweeping as well, and for trimming the fat. We have to kill our meals here, have to look the little things right in the eye. And as far as the peaches go, you have to sort of prepare yourself for a messier life now. But that’s why they give you the fancy aprons! And the axe! &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Look, at this, apron. You’d think it was bulletproof, though those don’t exist no more. It’s definitely not axe proof. Ask 147, no - better not to ask 147 as a matter of fact. 147 lost an arm. This was called the apron test as sort of a common joke during long night of drinking, until the test became the day 147 had exactly half as many limbs above his waist as he did prior to the test. Sometimes, if it’s whispered, people call it the Tom Test (that’s 1-4-7’s birth name) but you didn’t hear it from me.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“As you can see, we live in these round sort of clay and grass huts here. Couple of reasons for it: as the committees made their selections about what tools came and went, they sort of made it a game - like first, no tools just hands, show us what you’ve got. So we fell some trees, but what were we to do, eat our way through? So, without a nice table saw, you can’t cut the wood blocks into nice building materials like we used to.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That’s one, and two, yes, that rumor is true, we’re a candlelight village, if you catch my drift, so even if we had a bleeding table saw, couldn’t see the damn things from the clay huts. They’re dark on all days, long ones, short ones. And it rains like hell here, so good luck with wood outside anyway, and where’s the forest to begin with, right? I used to think if we did have a table saw, we’d probably need to make the blade manual, which I imagine would be like them stationary bicycles that people used to bring to events at the turn of the second millenium: when you peddled a blender turned fruit into smoothies, but somebody would have to reinvent bikes. I never understood how them chains worked.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’d like you to hold this a moment, it’s your can afterall. What did you say your name was? I’m kidding. You’re two-hundred-twenty-seven. Remember that spelled out. Did they tell you already? They like for you to spell it out when they do the bunk check after curfew. They also like to play games about this. For instance, if you can find a monosyllabic stepping stone inside your number, take for instance, T. W. O. - (always say the dash) H. U. N. DRED - you use it! You say, “dred” right in the middle of the letter call. But, you don’t get to use this shortcut twice, so seven still gets spelled and called out all the way? Got it?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s fun here, you’ll see. This is your coveralls. See, two-two-seven! Remember you say hundred. Maybe throw them on after your first can though, might have a mess on your hands.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">103 tosses the coveralls at 227, which is also the first time he’s stopped talking since the two of them started walking towards what appears to be 227’s new clay hut. 227 leans into the coveralls to catch them with her head, since the axe in her left hand is heavy and she doesn’t want to drop the peaches. She slides the coveralls to her shoulder. 103 raises his thumb, smiles, nods.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">103 smells like tree-bark, shit, and peaches. His blonde beard is like steel wool. 227 can remember steel wool. She can remember all sorts of household cleaners that were kept under a sink in another life. She pictures removing a thin blade of the wool from under her thumb. She thinks about what a bar soap would do for the caked mud on 103’s bicep, which is nearest her face as they walk. He is a massive specimen, she cannot help but admire the pure size of the man at her side.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“So, you gonna open them?” She can feel the liquid bob in the can. She hasn’t had anything to drink since she was taken. She rests the can gently against a short stone wall outside the hut, brings the lower axe tip, it’s sharp corner, to the edge of the can.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Very good,” 103 interrupts from over her shoulder. She lines the axe tip against the inner edge of the can, lifts both the can and the axe together, the can in her left hand and the axe in her right, and brings them both down with a cautious force against the rock. She pulls her hand off the can, keeping her right hand steady around the axe. She lifts the axe, hears a satisfying crisp release of the tip from the hole in the can’s top. 227 turns to 103 and smiles at the brute, lifting the can to her lips and takes a long satisfying chug from it. The peach juice is just as she’d hoped, sweet, watery, she takes the whole can in several quick gulps.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well done,” the man erupts so anyone else in this mud village can hear. “Fantastic. You’ll do right well here.” He smiles wide and places his large hand on her round shoulder. “But one thing 227, the peaches are where we get all our water.” 103 pats her back with his square fingers. “So it’s super important to remember - just a can a day. That’s the ration. Welcome to the world.”</p>

      <title>Bird Feet</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2018/5/30/birds-feet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">These two words are what she thought of when Beverly closed her eyes and blew out the candles:&nbsp;<em>Bird feet</em>. Her family and she gnashed through the cake like rodents and retired to their quarters of the tree. Mom and dad liked to hang by their tails off the tall branch in the center of the old cedar. She went to sleep in the tree’s stump, stowed away in the darkness of the expansive space inside, her paws wrapped in a blanket. She looked out through the far side of her dwelling, a small circular entrance, up at the branches, and past the branches at the stars.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Too young still to hang for the evening, too small to not be gobbled by a flying predator, Beverly scratched her nails against each other dreaming of the talons of mighty birds, listening to her siblings scuttle, switch sides, giggle, whisper, gnash, tucked in a different hole in the tree. She was born without a paw on her back leg. Before the rest of the litter was to eat Beverly her father intervened, scooping her loose sack of a body up in his sharp-toothed snout and pounced away. He brought her to and from her mother to feed while the other pups slept, lazily, on their backs, pawing at the air.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Beverly quickly grew too large to be sentenced to a savage death, but she could not sleep with the rest of the litter. Their red eyes and pink snouts scared her, they scowled when she was near, filled her sleep with night tremors. She was given a private life. Her father portioned off the stump to her. She’d be off the ground enough to evade any slithering predators, and tucked in far enough to avoid the flying ones.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With her father’s help she learned to walk. She peddled with her front legs while propelling herself forward with her hind one. She would lift her pawless leg off the ground. While it dangled, she found her balance. She developed a slow and fast pace and a tendency to grind her teeth when determined.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She liked watching fish in the river. She liked following the current to its break, against a rock or a branch, the way the water swirled into new shapes from something just beneath the surface. Her father would lift her by her neck and toss her in. She swam awkwardly, but with great purpose, happily lifting the point of her snout up, closing her eyes with each smile as she fought like mad to stay afloat. Beverly scratched the rock surface of the shallow river, clipped her nails to bleeding. She would curse the river for such pain, forget the pain, and return again.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dusk setting into darkness, now alone on such a voyage, tracing the steps of the forest, and without the aid of her father the young Beverly found a pattern in the dirt, four lines stemming off of a single point in sets of two. She found a scent placing her snout down in the dirt near the marks and followed their trail. In and around trees, away from the brush she squirmed chasing the pattern. Then she came upon them: chickens in a pen. They’d pecked a hole through the wire but appeared to have returned to their holding cell.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Beverly watched the birds dart their head as they paced, lifting their feet in almost circular motions, occasionally taking flight. She was transfixed by the movements. The darting heads. The lifted feet. The claws pressing the ground, stamping an impression. She looked at her pink tail, at its rings and felt it shared a kinship to these naked feet, that maybe she and these birds were somehow related, maybe even only their appendages.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then she saw a glorious thing, two of the male birds pacing around each other, filling their bird chests with air, blinking their wild eyes between long held stares, between wide pronounced steps, back and forth. Then the blue-beaked cock jumped with both feet at the white-beaked cock and scratched its puffed chest. Three long tears from one claw across the chest made a ripping noise as the flying bird pounced the grounded bird into the wire, an echo rattled as their bodies pressed against the shaking chain link.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The hens were a chatter, a few feathers burst into the air descending like leaves on the mulch of the coupe floor. Beverly realized then that she was completely out of hiding, that she was in fact, sitting upright, close enough to the fencing to touch one of the birds, her paw, she realized was resting on a link. That’s when she heard her siblings, rousing out of the nearby ground shrubs. The other possums plunged into the canned light from the shadows, all red eyes at first, then shapes, then pink snouts and grey fur and naked tails, suspicion filling their eyes as they approached their sister.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The feeling was a wash. Her body lifted in the chaos, her paws scuttled at everything around her, at the flurry of movement. She tumbled into the cage, consumed by the clucking, the darting heads. She’s almost clawed by blue-beak whose chest flashed quickly in a blur over her. She is kin to no one. She wants to claw at her siblings. She felt the eyes of the hens blinking at her, shaking their feathers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Beverly found herself tucked away in her stump when she woke, her father on the tree floor, curled up by the entrance. He smiled as she focused on his silhouette, then his grey spiky fur, his white jowls, his dark eyes, his pink snout. He purred and approached Beverly, nuzzled her head with his own, felt her paws on his face. She looked at him and did not speak the words, but implied them with a look, <em>it cannot be you always saving me, papa, I must defend myself</em>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Her father motioned for her to climb further up into their tree. They followed the candlelight flickering high in the canopy. This is the cake. This is the room with the rest of the litter. This is her mom welcoming her to a party. The rest of the pups sat lazily around the table. They must have already been disciplined. The scrappiest of them had scratches on their faces. Scratches in threes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Beverly was lifted by the thought. They were the cause and the remedy. And what was more, they were fallible. The chickens pierced their shared skin. This is when she was invited to blow out the candles. This is when she thought of having birds feet. Though she would not fly she would scratch and claw.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A new sensation tingles past the part of her leg where her missing paw should be. She curls the appendage. She raises it against her other hind leg and feels the hard edges of her new talons. She rustles out of the covers to see. Four beautiful chicken feet. She raises each off the ground individually. She looks at the underside of each claw. She paces slowly around the room, quickly mastering the opening warble. She struts. She sashays her tail. Then she leaps out into the world.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Jump forward, head back, look forward</em>. One leap. Two leaps. A Full body tumble. A pounce. A bounce. <em>Jump backwards, head forward, look back</em>. Looking back she couldn’t believe her luck. Looking back she saw the bottoms of her upturned claws, smiled because they did match her naked tail. Beverly closed her eyes in mid air. It felt like flying.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Stanley stands outside the lemon yellow building with his family. They came to see the Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas. The installation “Exhale” is a series of eighteen two-story tall sculptures of the letter “a” in lowercase following a three-story tall capital “A.” It’s one of these public art pieces on the Boulevard. As Stanley said, “One of these, what do you call them, moments?” Nobody calls the exhibit by its name, people say they’re going to see the Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Stanley thinks the hotel name means Eat. They are visiting, from America, and are hungry. They wonder if it’s the open mouth shout of the Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaas that has made the hotel so hungry, caught on the idea that it means eat. They thought the exhibit was a scream. They each took their pictures in front of a different “a.” Robby held his phone up, it is the newest, and snapped the pics. In each a family member is shouting in mock terror.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Robby lifts his phone up to the hotel marquee, places the translation camera over the word ÉTÊ and the app turns the word to “SUMMER.” Stanley says, “So, let’s eat.” Then he laughed from his belly which he patted as he bobbed inside the hotel.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Inside the hotel there is a narrow path of checkered tile that curves beneath sand from both sides of the long entry. The sand looks as if it has overtaken the place, more than it has been placed here. On the far wall is a dusty palm tree painted against the marble tile. The check-in counter is overgrown with ivy, a lot of which is just dead vine still holding its grip..</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You’d think they could keep the ivy alive,” says Betty, Robby’s wife. “It’s ivy.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Look at this,” says Stanley, his back to the rest near a wide, grand old stairwell. On the first landing sits a large stained glass window, a golden beach with a white chair and a yellow umbrella in the foreground, a blood red and orange sky behind. On the landing itself are a few slightly deflated beach balls, all quartered in white and sky blue. Stanley begins up the stairs.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Dad,” says Robby, “You think we should wait for someone?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Like who?” says Stanley, “A frickin’ ghost?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A cold wind blows through the lobby kicking sand up at the family. Robby brushes away some speks and follows his father. Robby’s mom, Darlene, and his wife keep close behind.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Looks like an old movie,” says Betty.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I don’t miss the old movies,” says Darlene. “New ones are more fancy, they tell the stories quicker.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The men are wearing straw hats, looking like tourist explorers. On the mezzanine they can hear the faint crawl of the ocean, the whish of the water creeping over the sand and pulling back. The marble walls are black with white cracks that paint a whisper of life against the false night sky. Robby passes his father, heads towards the sound of the waves. He’s first to feel the water over his feet.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On the landing Darlene is touching the stained glass “This has a dimension to it,” she whispers to Betty. “Looks like the beach goes on forever.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The beach looks like it continues that way,” says Betty, as she extends her arm into and past the glass. “Well, would you look at that?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’ve always wanted to have my picture painted,” says Darlene with a wink, as she steps onto the glass’s sand and into the frame. Betty follows her inside the mural, bathed in its sky’s red light. Their colorful dresses turn from patterned white to gloss pink; their faces, obscured by shadows, become the simplest shapes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The water soaks both men’s shoes. Robby removes his and tosses them back towards what he imagines is the shore. Stanley has determined that he should keep his on, should they be needed after the swim.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I think there’s another stairwell,” says Robby to his dad. He fumbles his phone out of his pocket to access the flashlight. He steers the white light away from them. The water quakes and crests, growing in height and ferocity.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Those white caps?” asks Stanley as the waves begin to thrash. Robby throws Stanley his phone and dives in head first. Stanley fumbles with the phone, directing its light towards the bare feet of his son as he kicks away towards the staircase he himself could not see. “Maybe come back now, Robby,” Stanley shouts. “Robby!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The waves go calm, and the vast room falls silent. Stanley, waist deep in the water, takes a few large steps backward to what he imagines is the shore and just as soon trips, feeling the hard edge of something against his ankle. He falls backwards on another set of stairs.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Stanley closes his eyes now, to turn and take the stairs. He feels each step out with a foot in front of him. It is easier this way, to avoid being spooked. He squints in the darkness now and again to see if anything new has announced itself. His hands, shaking from the cold, reach to their sides and he finds a wooden banister. He removes his waterlogged shoes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With the aid of the handrail Stanley quickened his pace, ascending the stairs, finding their curve, and soon the next floor. This is golfing green beneath him, he can tell by the bristled top and the slight cushion. He opens his eyes. A single beam of dusty light spreads across the abandoned course. It is eighteen greens, spread out, bordered by lines of sideways brick. A mini-golf course. An old windmill is frozen, as if the spiders themselves stopped it in place with their now thick webs. Is that a carousel in the distance? Stanley can hear the xylophone bells of an old music box cranking to life.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When he was a child they went to a place like this. They’d speed through it like a task on a list. They’d go through each game quickly, enjoying the seconds as they passed before it was too late and they had the chance to look back, because they wouldn’t play again, even if the course was empty. After there was always the reward of ice cream, if not a cone, than a float, and the tallying of scores. He could smell buttered popcorn in his memories.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After considering a round of golf, making it so far as to grab the putter and select a ball, yellow, Stanley spots a flicker of light in his periphery. A moving white triangle of light twinkles atop the last stairwell, the light of a projectionist’s room, the flicker of shadows and shapes from a screen.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He creeps his way up the stairs to a large open theatre. In black and white on the screen is Stanley and his wife and their son, and his wife. They are running around the exhibit, they are laughing and smiling, they are holding up their phones and snapping photos. They are placing their hands against their cheeks and shouting.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Stanley runs from the room to where he thought were the stairs. Now there is just a plain door with the word EXIT clearly marked in green letters on a white box. He opens the door to a surprise of fresh air and daylight. He walks out onto the roof of the hotel Étê. Stanley paces the flat space. It is a clear day, there is a row of beach chairs in a line on one side of the pool. The pool water is perfectly still.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is a glass railing along the edge of the building. He walks close to the edge to look down. He reaches for the railing but feels nothing there. Below, beside the letters that run down the center of the boulevard, as Stanley's bare feet reach the edge of the roof and curl over its edge, his family is waving their arms, shouting.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You got your mother’s spots. You got my hands and feet. This is nice, mine are long. We used to take you on trips, even when you were breathing liquid, when you were one of a thousand fruit sizes, growing, tumbling, kicking, burping. I used to close my eyes to find your mom in the dark. Now I find my way in and out of your room when you lose the pacifier in your sleep.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I measure time between when you are asleep and when you are awake. I used to measure time between when I slept and when I could have a drink. I was a big mess. I used to forget when to eat, until I needed to eat to make sure you eat. I used to find an empty fridge in the morning.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I can’t sleep without future meals in the cupboards and frozen milk cubes in the freezer. You grew teeth early and are always crunching ice. So I make you ice cubes out of everything. I am lucky for your teeth. I thank the sky for them. I can buy fresh anything and chop it into a powder to make the cubes. Then you crunch for days.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You like fresh cheeses. This too is lucky and easy for me, because I like them too. All I have to do is restrain myself just enough to save some for you before I eat all the way through my hands.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I can never tell if there was a time before this time and after. Sometimes I dream about a place and time and you are not there. This is when I wake up and have to run into your room and make sure you are real. This is when I wake you up to play in the middle of the night. First you are angry, then you are giggling, then we are both asleep and waking up on the couch again with the cheese plate empty beside us. This is when I feed you ice for breakfast.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When your mom is home she makes sure I don’t wake you up in the middle of the night to play. She keeps us on a schedule. She tries to imagine what it would be like without me, sometimes, I do not get angry at her for it. I just clean everything up around us and hope she realizes how much extra time there is to take pictures of you two and your matching spots.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One time, it got really late and you were not asleep and your mom was still at work, and you did not want to sleep the first try. So we looked at some books and danced to some polka music. I walked you back into your room and placed you in your giant crib. You wrapped your long fingers around my big finger. I rubbed your butt with my other hand and you fell asleep looking up at me. You have my eyebrows too, and you like to dry hump the bed and wiggle your butt to put yourself to sleep. You’re going to do that for your whole life. I know this thing.</p>

This is everything. The bridge is next. Then it’s one-two-hips. Then the shimmy. Then that fem-move with the loose wrists and the sass, the back and forths. Elbows at sides, forearms at right angles. Be the crane. Twin Cranes. Lifting nothing but hopes. Keep your eyes closed for it. Let the smile fill your face at the end. Let smiles fill the room.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You are air. You are movement. The chorus is up-nod, snap, then left foot behind the body. Shift your weight, press into the back leg. Twist. Press into the softwood and shift the weight, knee up and spin spin spin.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then the Baker. You call it the Baker, like you are stretching dough between the hand raised above your head and the hand beneath your waist. You are making an eight, your arms two loops, your body a straight line connecting the rings. The Baker. You close your eyes and hold it. This song has no fade. This is a hard stop. You have so much bread.&nbsp;There are so many hungry mouths out there.&nbsp;</p>

      <title>Xander Clem by the Sea</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2018/6/13/xander-clem-by-the-sea</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sitting along the coastline of the Nincquontandle Peninsula on his twenty-ninth birthday Xander Clem, the future-youngest smarty of all smarties, discovered an anomaly. Here, at the edge of the world, in a place where his people were scarce the flying things communicated with the swimming things. He looked on in quiet wonder as the squirmers and snips corralled near the musks. The lengthy toomba swimmers, who like to chomp through clumps of little swimmers, circled the school as it formed a dark sphere in the water, a living marble just beneath the surface.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Caws and stripe-wings flocked above the surface diving down into the green water to catch mouthfuls of snip. All of this seemed perfectly normal - the small things being hunted and eaten by the bigger things. The flying things torpedoing into the water and emerging with fresh meals.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then the anomaly: a button-nosed musk, a swimmer of high intelligence, arose from the water to join the caws and stripe-wings. Its fins extended beyond their normal boundaries as it hovered in the air among its new flock. Some kind of immediate evolution took place between the sea and the sky. Now like the other flyers, the musk dipped back into and out of the water, a guzzle full of squirmers in its beak. Other musks followed and a new species was discovered by the young fellow.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For the next three years Xander camped on the coast and watched the sea. His reports became more and more unrealistic sounding: <em>A scientist at the edge of the world is training wild leg-crabs. A school of cormoran plankers laugh on command, fins across bellies, backs against the ocean. Two burst-tooth cham-chams </em>(deadly predators of the very deep)<em> available for saddle-backed sunset swims</em>: <em>Tourists welcome! </em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He meets a girl named Chlorephonyon his thirty-second birthday. She has come here to be near the water. She has heard of the young man responsible for talking to the sea. She makes her way to his seaside laboratory, occupied solely by him. He uses all of his good lines: “Do you come here often?” and “Wow, the weather is today!” and “I haven’t met you here before.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She is not charmed by him because he has no charm within him. Yet, she stays on, offering her assistance to the one who speaks to the swimmers. Chlorephony had romantic ideals coming here, but they weren’t filled with the actual smells of the region. Swimmers and flying things eat from the sea, and they omit what is leftover near where they nest. Xander nests near these nests. She found herself holding her breath those first several weeks.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Just the proximity to a woman made in the shapes that women are made rendered Xander delirious. He concealed his pesky erection and took her to the sea. They boat far off the shore in an unimpressive little skiff. His mouth waters. His brow sweats. His teeth chatter. Any word configurations sprung from his lips are horrible slogs of confusion. Yet once they arrive, sitting above species of great danger he is calm, collected. He forgets Chlorephony’s scent and focuses on the slow approach of a beast in the wake of their boat.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Chlorephony takes her time acclimating to the sea. She does not wish to ride the sea beasts, nor does she wish to spend additional time with the scientist she sought. However, this place at the edge of their world is lonely. Often it is only the two of them for weeks on end as the only option for conversing, for any contact. He blunders. She cringes. He orchestrates a parade of leg-crabs to a song. She laughs. After a few months she offers her bosom to his hand. He keels over in excitement, eyes rolled back in his skull. More time passes. She decides she is ready for the sea and that she may as well settle down with this strange man, who is handsome enough, so long as he isn’t speaking. She plans to tell him that evening, she has forgone the company of another for far too long.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She dies. Of course, before this takes place. The moment he positions her atop the cham-cham, while out deep in the water, its mate bursts out of the sea and, mouth agape, snatches her off the saddle. He loved her the moment she arrived. He’d used all his good lines. She’d stuck around. That was enough. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The town wades through bureaucratic corrosion. Developers market the seaside. Then scientists fight the developers. Then tourists come to stay in the developments. The specialness erodes. Trash and build up, the natural beauty unprotected, wrinkles, and fades. The creatures take note. More children are eaten now than ever before by the beasties beneath. Xander Clem’s anomalies migrate elsewhere.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Xander’s work suffers from the distractions of quick death and newfound heartbreak. The scientist believed he was finished. When the phone rang at his edge of the world, and the curious proposition to discuss his findings with some scientists interested in space exploration he didn’t even pack a suitcase. He left the shoreline of his youth, in something of a hurry.</p>

      <title>Rutherford Kensington Returns</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2018/8/22/rutherford-kensington-returns</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After the bandage was removed, after he was discharged from the hospital, well after the chair was gently lifted from its reclining state, and the woozy feeling of blood re-circulated around his body Rutherford Kensington returned to the Leisure Centre. It was half-four in the morning when he arrived, after the sun had left this part of the sky, after a bus ride that was thwarted by a lack of payment which led to a cash machine and a long walk to return to the station to catch an even later bus. Rutherford held the twin doors that lead to the front desk which stands between him and the locker room that leads to the pool, and pulled to no avail. Having nothing else on his mind Rutherford sat down on the steps to wait.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After the sun came up over the hillside, after a garbage truck stopped its way up the street, after Rutherford gathered a small yellow flower from betwixt two concrete slabs of pathway and returned to his perch, another bus hissed its doors open and out walked a woman whose head tilted at the site of this sitting man on those steps. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s you,” said she, “you’re okay.” Rutherford replied, “‘tis me, I am okay.” The woman sat beside Rutherford, the two of them looked out at the street slowly crawling to life.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Are you as hungry as I am?” he asked.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I usually have a gnash after a swim,” she replied.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Very well,” he said. “After you’ve swam, and after you’ve dried, and after you place the clothes you’re now wearing back onto your body, and after we meet again and walk to the diner up the way, you and I will have some dinner.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It will be breakfast time then, love,” she said.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh, I see,” said Rutherford, looking out after everything. “I feel like there’s something I was meant to say.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“After dinner perhaps,” said the woman.</p>

      <title>The Luggage: A Re-Tale</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2018/8/15/the-luggage-a-re-tale</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I stepped on a flower on the crooked road to work. The blue lights that hang low in the basement office buzz like cicadas. Everybody has dandruff. Lurch sits near the coffee machine with the curdled creamers. Mr. Wahoo Watooh sits behind his big desk. He’s on his read phone screaming at Lenny. I sit in the file room by myself while DeeDee sneezes into a box of kleenexes nextdoor in the bright light.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I take out my rotating music box desk lamp to ease the pain of the buzzing lights. Wahoo immediately bursts in and tells me to lose the lamp. “I got a headache,” I tell him. “Every day lately. I don’t feel good.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Wahoo says, “nobody feels good. After childhood, it’s a facts from life.” Then Wahoo tells me to get rid of my freakin’ lamp for real this time.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I go to my doctor. He tells me I got a bad disease. He says they wouldn’t have even found it had I not insisted on so many visits, but they did spot it. “Brain Cloud,” Doc says. “Right down the middle of your brain, a cloud of grey smoke. Very rare.” Then he drops the truth: “you have six months to live.” I knew it. I mean, I didn’t know it. But I knew it. Freakin’ Brain Cloud. I leave the doctor’s office and hug a big dog and then I hug the big dog’s small owner.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I go to work and quit. I tell Wahoo the coffee stinks. I tell him the lights are suckin’ the friggin’ life out of everybody. Then I tell Wahoo he’s a joke, and that this life is no life. I tell him this ain’t living. Then I tell him we should get him fitted for a funeral suit, ‘cause he’s basically dead already. Then I ask DeeDee on a date, because her smell is the only reason this place isn’t hell on earth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Me and DeeDee go on a date. We talk about life’s big mysteries and eat lobster. I feel good. DeeDee tells me I never feel good. And she’s right! I never do. I wiggle my hands over my glands. We laugh at this, like kids, like teens, then we have a hot make. She comes back to my place and I tell her, I’m gonna die. She hates this news and leaves immediately. I feel a little silly for telling her, but I was honest, so there’s that.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Some geezer knocks on my door in the morning with a duck billed umbrella. He asks if I got whiskey. I tell him “it’s nine am, buddy.” He pulls peanuts out of a magic jacket pocket and offers me one, then says, “not a nice place you got here Jurr.” Then he pummels the duck-head of his umbrella through my wall. This old buzzard looks at me after and says, “I’m trying to see the hero in there.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I say, “Mister?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He says, “I find it totes amaze-maze you haven’t demanded my name.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I shrug my shoulders. He lights his pipe in my living room and says, I wants to hire you, Jurr Burnks, to jump into a volcano.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What do you want me to do?” I ask.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He tells me about a island with some orange soda loving freaks who need me to jump into their volcano in exchange for some boobooroo, which is some stuff the old guy needs for his superconductors. Then he tells me he’ll pay for anything I’d ever want in my life for the next six months until I take the plunge.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So I tell him, “K, I’ll do it.”</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I get picked up in a limo by a fella who’s super smooth. He asks me, “where to?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I say, “Need to buy some clothes.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He says, “Mister, you hinting around ‘bout clothes. Clothes make the man, I believe that.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I say, “sure.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He says, “Asking ‘bout clothes is like asking me who you are. I’ve worked my whole life to figure out who I am, and I am tired.” He looks back at me and sees I need help. Then he says, “I’m coming back.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He says his name is Marsh-marsh and asks, “What kind of clothes you got?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I say, “The clothes I’m wearing.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Marsh-marsh says, “So you got no clothes.” Dang.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He drives me all over the city. He calls this fancy hair dresser and we go tuxedo shopping and I say I’ll only buy a tux if he lets me buy him a tux. So we both get tuxes, ‘cause Marsh-marsh’s giving me all kinds of free advice and is super sweet and is also my best friend. Then he takes me to the luggage store.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A man in the luggage store brings me into a secret room. There are painted blue sky ceilings. Angels sing overhead. The man is very well dressed. He looks me up and down and says, “Luggage is the central preoccupation of my life.” And I look him up and down and am like, “I got no response to that.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Luggage man wheels out their premiere steamer trunk. Says, “This is our premiere steamer trunk.” This thing’s got all kinds of drawers and compartments. It’s watertight. I love it. I tell him I’ll take four. He says, “may you live to see a thousand lives, sir.” I don’t have the heart to tell him I’m on my way to jump in the fire pit, so I say, sure thing and off I go.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I say goodbye to my best friend Marsh-marsh and jump on a plane to Lala where this flibberdeegibit picks me up. I feel like I’ve seen her before. She’s got bright red frizz hair and the same face as DeeDee, but I can’t remember this in the moment. This is the old buzzard who hired me’s daughter. She wears neon yellow and doesn’t hear anything I’m saying. She says, “You Jurr Burnks?” And I’m like, “sure.” And she’s like, “let’s ride.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She drives me through the hills and talks about how Lala smells bad but she loves it. We eat crab monsters that she likes to smash up plenty with a wood mallet. Her artwork hangs all over the restaurant. It’s her dad’s restaurant. I guess that guy owns all sorts of things. We sit on a cliff and talk about death. I tell her don’t kill yourself ‘cause life’s too short. Then she says this conversation is totes typical, and it’s totes typical to be open and share feelings. I tell her I don’t know her, that I don’t pretend to know anything, then I say &nbsp;I’m tired and she drives me home.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The next morning I dress in a safari outfit. Then the flibberdeegibit drives me to the ocean where her half sister is waiting to take me across the sea to the island with the lava monster. Her half sister and her have the same faces, but way different looks. She stands in high-waisted shorts and crosses her arms and says, “Hello, Frangelica.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Hello, Trish-tricia,” says the flibberdeegibit.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What’s with those clothes, Felix,” says Trish-tricia.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’m Jurr Burnks,” I tell her.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That outfit’s wearing you, Felix,” she says.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You can call me Jurrsurp, or JURR,” I yell from the docks.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“OK Felix,” she says. “I’ll call you Jurr.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is a weird way to start.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So I jump on this tiny sailboat with Trish-tricia, some fishmongers and a german spy named Dagmar. It’s a nice boat, it fits all my luggage. We sit under the stars at night and talk about the world working.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Sorry I was rude to you,” says Tricia, “back at the docks. You work for my dad, and I don’t like my dad no more.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s cool,” I tell her.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I don’t know where we’re going or what we’re doing, only that we’re going to an orange soda slurper island in the middle of the friggin’ ocean.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Look,” I say, “the world is an incredible freaking place, and we’re sitting under the stars, and I’d never even been to Lala before a couple days ago. You live on this boat, that situation is incredible to me. Them stars is incredible to me. Boats, are incredible to me.” Then I ask her if she believes in the big guy.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I believe in myself,” she says. Pretty tough lady.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She shows me my bunk and cabin. And says I’m gonna dream in crazy aways. Then she says, “I sold out and didn’t listen to David Byrne. I took money and this boat instead of standing up to my dad and I’m soul sick on a tiny boat for who knows how long.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m like damn, tomorrow’s gonna be a better day. But I don’t say nothing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Um, tomorrow is a way friggin’ better day. We eat hot dogs off a grill. We fish off the back of the boat. I catch in this order: a sweet freaking boot, a garbage bag full of seaweed, and a friggin’ hammerhead shark that tries to eat the crew. It’s super friggin’ sweet, freeze frame!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That night the ocean grumbles and we sleep until the morning when the whole friggin’ world is neon green.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Trisch-tricia is like, “Ever been in a friggin’ storm before?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m all, “No.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She’s like, “buckle up Jurr, you’re in for a ride.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The storm is a freakin’ power house. Waves the size of a mountain crash all over the place. Lightning lightnings throughout the sky. The fish must be like, oh fireworks, but we are all like, holy pajamas this is friggin’ scary biz. A lightning bolt hits the boat. Trisch-tricia tries to grab something and gets knocked in the head and off the boat by the mast. I learned all kinds of parts of a boat thing during the fish party. I dive in after my girl.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m all alone in the water and I find Trisch-tricia and swim her to the surface of the massive deep. I put her on a little life-saving tube and then the frigging sweetest thing in the whole world happens: out of the water pops, one, two, three, all four pieces of my matched airtight, freaking sweet luggage, the premiere steamer trunks. Boom!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I leave Trisch-tricia on her tube and I go swimming for my sweet luggage. I connect all four trunks together to make, probably, without a doubt the coolest raft on the planet and definitely in the water. I have access to all the cool stuff I bought before the trip. I throw Trisch-tricia up top, and have like several sweet days of deeply introspective partying.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here’s what’s in my trunks: a perfectly in-tune ukulele, a champagne bar-kit hidden in a violin case, seven beach balls, one hand held radio, seventeen pairs of underwear, a tux, some sweet swimmers, a couple of ham sandwiches, a tube full of fruit snacks, a mini-tank set with little army men, two hats, one beach umbrella, and a frigging sweet mini-golf set with a putter, a green, and three balls.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I play mini-golf for two days while I feed my sweet friend Trisch-tricia water from a shot glass. I play cowboy songs on ukulele. I dance to some sweet tunes from the transistor radio channels I can pick up. I learn how to do one-handed pushups, splits, and tai-chi, and I also get pretty drunk and really sunburned. On like the sixth night I talk to the moon.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I say, “moon, and god, who’s name I don’t know, thank you for my life.” Then I pass out because I don’t know it, but I have sun poison.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Trisch-tricia wakes me up and asks if I saved any water for me. And then we here them, out in the distance, the freakin’ island people who love orange soda. They ride on sweet canoes to us and sing magic songs probably about soda, because they wear soda cans, and drink soda cans, and have skin the color of orange soda, and their friggin’ volcano is prolly orange soda too. They’re a jolly bunch, we go to meet the chief.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Chief says, “My people, they like this soda, so, we need a hero.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I say, “Ok.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Trisch-tricia, “says, wait what?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m like, “yeah, I’m here to jump.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then we have a big getting ready party where everybody is bathed in flowers and I get punched by bats and they stick an octopus on my face. I put on my sweet freaking tux and Trisch-tricia gets dressed in a sweet dress and flowers and we walk up the volcano to have a jump-in party.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Trisch-tricia stops everything and says, “hold on a second! I love you.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m like, “woah!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’ve never been with love for other peoples.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I say, “guess what, I love you too. But, timing stinks!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She says, “Marry me!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m like, “what?!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She says, “you gotta honor me for like three seconds.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m like, “true.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The chief says, “You marry him, you marry her, boom, you’re married!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We’re both super happy and I’m like, “K, gotta go.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My new bride is like, “wait, why?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I say, “Gotta be brave, gotta jump in!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then Trisch-tricia says, “I’m coming with you!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’m like, “no way.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She’s like, “I’m self willed. And I’m jumping too.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I say, “I walked my whole life on a crooked road to come here and find you.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We’ll jump in,” she says, “and we’ll see. So, take my hand.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So me and my sweet wife jump into the orange soda volcano and boom, that thing pops us straight out like a rocket. We fly through the air and breathe in the sweet smell of the ocean and see the magic of the stars up close and then splash we land in the water.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The island sinks and we watch it sink and are sad for the orange soda lovers. Then like five minutes later like a sweet freaking machine of awesome partying one, two, three, four steamer trunks pop out of the water right in front of us. My friggin’ luggage is so sweet! Freeze frame!</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I swallowed a quarter. The thin sliver of cupronickel slid down my throat. Lying on my back, I tucked my thumbnail below the face of the coin and flicked it into the air. When I failed to catch it I craned my neck and the quarter plunged to the back of my throat. I had enough time to consider my life: this studio apartment in this very tall building, the cheap desk I recently spent the sunniest day in weeks building, the stained white doilies I use for coasters, the red wine rings on the raw wood table I hide with the coasters, a closet full of hand-knit frocks, a landline, an answering machine with no messages.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Briefly, I held the quarter between my thumb and forefinger, while lodged in the entryway to my throat, my mouth open wide around my knuckles. I was still on my back but the coin was already too slick with mucus to keep the grip, I was breathing like a glue huffer, and in my panic, I involuntarily moved my head up towards my legs. Down my pipes the quarter slid.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I sit up. I am afraid to bring myself to the hospital. I am afraid the moment I am in motion the quarter will position itself to block whatever tube it is in. I dial my mother’s number. I move slowly, keeping my spine straight as I punch the numbers from memory. She is not at home. She is in fact on another continent, I am now remembering, with her new husband. A safari. She sent a picture of them in their new hats. I call my sister whose arms are full of children, in a city across this country. Of course she does not answer.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I dress for my funeral. I move like the dance when you pretend to be a robot. When I spill feces into my underwear after doubling over from not breathing somewhere across 78th street I don’t want someone digging through my drawers looking for more appropriate clothes to dress my body in. <em>You are alone</em>, I tell myself. <em>You will walk maybe thirty steps before you clasp at the air, reaching like a mime towards the sky</em>. And there I will double over, not holding my neck, but my stomach where the world of my inside pipes is divided by George Washington’s wigged head and what? A stalk of wheat?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I write a note:</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>I, Delores Ponce, have swallowed a quarter. I did not go to work today. Instead I laid on my back, for the last time, allowing my daydreams to paralyze me. With my spare hand I flicked a quarter in the air. Before I climaxed I pictured a man on horseback reading a map with no words. On the map was a picture of me, the lines under my eyes were sky blue rivers, my nose was a red mountain, my eyes: green lakes. In the man’s hand was his erect penis. He stared at my picture as the sun set behind him. His leather saddle glistened in the golden light. A hangman’s noose hung round his neck, and his horse was slowly walking away from the tree they were under. When I opened my eyes the coin was spinning towards my mouth.&nbsp;</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Please take the keys from my pocket and loot my apartment. Burn my body to ash. Scatter the dust I leave in Monument Valley. I spent too many nights alone on this island, while never getting close enough to the dry heat of the desert, or the warm embrace of a gentleman rider.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I fold the note and place it in my front dress pocket, smooth the dress over and head downstairs. Though I am sure I will be dead momentarily I stop across the street at a bar. I’ve watched this place open and close from my bedroom window, but have never entered. A tall man dries a bulbed glass behind the counter. He nods to me and says nothing. I realize if I order a drink that the liquid will move the quarter into the blocking position.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I swallowed a quarter,” I blurt. I sound almost proud.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You what?” asks the barman.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I swallowed a quarter,” I reply, getting a hold of myself. “I think I should go to the hospital.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I will call you a cab,” says the barman.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“A cab?” I ask. “Don’t I need an amb-”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I swallowed a quarter when I was a kid,” he says. “You’ll be alright.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“How do you know?” I ask.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Lady,” he says, like a cowboy from a dream, “You just walked into my bar.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I am not going to die?” I ask.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Nah,” he says, “you’ll be fine.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The barman pours me a drink with a lemon twist that looks and tastes like cough syrup. I sit down and wait for my cab. Under my drink is a sturdy cardboard coaster, catching all the sweat beads as they collect at the glass’ base. Before I leave I reach into the front pocket of my dress, tuck the key to my apartment into the fold of the paper and slide the note across the bar. "In case I don’t make it," I say, "just follow the note."&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I exit the bar. I imagine the barman sitting upright in my bed when I return home. He is waiting with his palms flat atop my comforter. Next to him is a dinner plate with a perfectly stacked pyramid of quarters. I taste the flavor of copper and nickel in my throat. I picture my hand reaching out as I lock eyes with him. I pinch the top coin off the pile, place it delicately near the back of my tongue. I look at him as I swallow. One by one I consume each quarter until he cannot resist the craving to taste the alloy again for himself. </p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Doctor Vanman gets a call from Spangles and Rick about a new goblin in the public book depository. She’s a float vapor. Up until just now these nerds’ research hasn’t brought them that close to actual visible demons. The book lady is laid out flat, panting from the haunt situation. She’s freaked! And Vanman is like, “you menstruating or what?” Everybody looks at Vanman, like, man? What’s that got to do with goblins?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They’re science men, Vanman explains, him,, Spangles, and Rick. They’re buddies too. They convince the book workers to let ‘em have a look at the vapor lady. She’s floating near the basement books. They turn the corner downstairs and everybody drops their jaws low. The vapor reads a ghost book, looks at Vanman and says, “shhhhh.” Then Rick is like, “fellas, follow my sweet lead.” Rick sneaks up on the float vapor and says “GET HER!” Some crazy piano music starts playing and the ghost lady chases the nerds straight out of the book party.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">About three seconds later these knuckleheads are fired from their university jobs because they’re spending all kinds of sweet time chasing goblins instead of teaching boring classes to yawning babes and the top brass think they’re a collective stinkbug on the college curtains. So, they’re out of a job and decide: hey, let’s be goblin chasers for a living. High fives!</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The three buds put Rick’s childhood house on the line and start making protein packs to chase goblins. They buy a fire house with a big pole and spiders. They build a ghost tank to put ghosts in once they catch ghosts. Everything that’s dangerous is red. Everything that is fun to play with is black. They buy a death mobile and put a cute ghoul on the side and start freakin’ chasing goblins.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A hotel man calls their new secretary Janice who wears big glasses and looks like a bug and says, “we got goblins!” So Janice pulls the fire alarm and sprays water over everything and the nerds slide down the pole to their protein packs and jump in their crazy car to the after party in the hotel dining room.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This guy from the hotel don’t like goblins. But they catch the slimeball with almost no probs, except Spangles tells everybody a major rule about chasing goblins: “don’t cross lasers with your protein pack or the bible will happen.” Everybody’s like, “wait what? The bible?” And Spangles is like, “it’s like a twinkie.” Nobody understands this, but they trust Spangles, ‘cause he’s like king friggin’ nerd of the pack.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They catch the ghoul. They pull the linen off the table with the plates still on it. They shake down the hotel guy for some cash for their hard work. Boom. They’re in freaking business!</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Across town near the center park live the Locksmith and the Housesitter. Louis Louis Vincenzi is the Locksmith. His buddies call him two shirts, he always rocks a turtleneck underneath a button down chaser. He likes triple-walled bifocals, dancing the twist, accounting with accountants, wide-buckled belts, animal skin luggage, throwing raging parties, and has a major collection of rare disco. He also is totes in love with his neighbor: Debbi Blanket.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Debbi Blanket is the Housesitter’s person name, before the demon-dogs find her and remind her that she’s really the Housesitter. She lives alone, in a big apartment with an old chair. Her kitchen is full of demons she doesn’t even know about. &nbsp;The Housesitter likes: jazzercise, eggs, broccoli, leggings, leg warmers, crop top tanks, shoulder-cut sweatshirts, listening to the viola, playing the viola, talking about playing the viola, red sequins, nerds, and styling mousse.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Louis Louis runs into Debbi totally on accident (he was waiting outside her door) and invites her to his sweet freaking party tonight. She’s like “maybe,” and he’s like “I’ll take maybe, sounds super sweet.” Then he, the freaking Locksmith of all people, locks himself out of his house. He calls the front desk for his third key this week. Debs goes to the store to buy some eggs.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Pretty much as soon as Debbi Blanket gets home from the market her eggs have a party on her kitchen counter. They jump out of the carton by-them-selves and the counter cooks the eggs, which is crazy town. Then her fridge has a mountain with a demon on it on the freaking shelf. And the fridge is like, DEEEEEEEEEEEEEBBBBBBBBBBSSSSS.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">That’s when Debbi Blanket calls Dr. Parker Vanman because she saw his stretched-out head on TV saying something about parabola activity, which her freaking live egg situation totes qualifies as.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Vanman comes in hot. He’s likes Debbi’s curls. He likes twinkling her piano and asks when the last time she had a fella around was. Debbi does not like Vanman. He’s a little bit of a creepazoid on the approach. And then he doesn’t believe her about the eggs and says her fridge is full of junk food. You can tell they’re gonna be together at least until the sequel. Vanman tells Debs to come in for more tests.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Back in We-Catch-Goblins &nbsp;HQ the Environmental Projection Agency stops in for a quick talk with bug eyes. She’s like, “waddayawant?” And he’s like, “let me see how this puppy works.” And she’s like, “nah, I’m not a doctor.” And then Vanman shows up, and is like, “I am a doctor,” all thumb to chest. So EPA guy with the fire-red hair, and the light beard and a furrowed brow all the time, says, “show me your toys, Dr. Van. Man.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Nah,” says Vanman, sort of playing with him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Where do you store the goblins?” presses this red haired nasty.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“In the storage tank,” says Vanman.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“May I see the tank,” says EPA. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You didn’t use any magic,” says Vanman.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What is magic?” asks the idiot.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Magic is asking nice,” says Vanman.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh,” says EPA, “May I please see the ghost tank?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Not right now,” says Vanman.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then red hair gets all fists of fury and screams about a judge and a warrant and about how he still hasn’t had lunch and that he’s super hungry and he’ll probably get a burrito and a warrant, and then a hot dog! “Welp, come on back soon,” says Vanman, patting the red dummy on his back and showing him the door.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Round about now Win-Win Sabormore comes over to apply for jobs. Rick and Spangles give him the rundown. They show him their ghoul catchers, the goblin storage tank, the locker room, the fire pole, they tell him they got two different beer fridges, and these sweet matching coveralls and they point to their names on their chests and are like, “your name would go where are names go on your own sweet freaking cover-alls.” Then they ask him if he believes in goblins.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Win-win is like, “I’ll believe anything you say if there’s a steady paycheck in it.” Everybody pats backs and he’s hired! Cigarettes all around!</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Back at her place Debbi gets home from a sweet Jazzercise class and runs into Louis Louis. He’s having that freakin’ sweet party,, he reminds her, gonna be a classic throwdown. He sees that she’s fresh off a cleanse and is like, “I juice too.” He’s smaller than her by a foot, which is very sad, but you can tell Louis Louis two-shirts is a generous lover and a general sweetie. Anyways, Debs only has eyes for Vanman now, even though she don’t even know it. She’s like, “cool beans, Louis Louis,” I’ll come by after I freshen my body places.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Louis Louis just gulps in response. Then he tries to open his door and he’s freaking locked out again. What a character. His guests let him back in and say the party is kind of a drag, so Louis Luois turns up the tunage and they bring it to the next!</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Down the road above the library some sweet Demon Dogs crack out from under the statues they were born in and tumble their way into Louis Louis and Debbi’s building. Unbeknownst to these two they’re about to become the Locksmith and the Housesitter.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Clouds gather over the city. Darkness creeps all over everything. Debs grabs a cold one from her filth fridge and sits on her old chair. She’s trying to check some sweet news and it’s all static. Before she can even adjust the rabbit ears two freaking demon dog claws rip right from out of her recliner and she gets taken into the realm of ghouls.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While Louis Louis is twisting with Yolanda from work another demon dog pounces into his place. He’s like, “ok, who brought the dog?” Everybody runs and screams. Then two-shirts is screaming too and he books it out of his place, and for sure gets locked out again.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The demon dog catches up to him while he’s pounding on the glass of a fancy TGIFridays and then he’s freaking caught too. His eyes turn red. He talks to a horse. Then he gets arrested because police don’t understand ghouls.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">About two hours later Spangles and Rick get a call from the police saying, “you guys the goblin chasers? We got a real sandwich of a guy here.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Vanman shows up at Deb’s place and she’s floating above the bed calling herself the freaking Housesitter. Vanman’s like, “Sitting house for what now?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And she’s all, “Are you the Locksmith or freaking what?” Then she starts breathing like a demon and Vanman calls the fellas.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“She says she’s the Housesitter,” he tells Spangles.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Ah, we got a fella, calls himself the Locksmith,” says Spangles.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh,” says Dr. Parker Vanman, “better get these two together.”</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Rick and Win-win drive around and talk about the bible. They’re trying to make sense of all the goblins they’ve been catching and want to understand why evil is evil. They’re lit red and they talk slow. They agree that there’s a whole factory of crazy going on in the neighborhood.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">EPA jughead shows up at Goblin Chaser HQ and is like, I’ve got a warrant you freaking turkeys. He’s got cops with him. They pull the lever on the ghost storage and the world erupts into a fiery rage. HQ gets a cloud of electric sunbeams shooting in and out of it and the newspaper flies around the city like mad while skeletons drive cabs.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Goblinchasers go to jail and are like, “Gimme the mayor.” And the cops are like, “mayor’s the one asking for you!” Boom! Everybody meets at the mayor’s place and Vanman makes it clear that EPA jerk was born without a penis. Then he’s like, “let us catch some freaking Goblins, Lenny! It means votes, you jag!”</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Cross town, the Locksmith and the Housesitter meet each other on the roof of their building which also looks like ancient rome. Dolic columns and stuff. They have a hot-make and don’t even have to say it, but are totally gonna destroy the world together. She is one foot taller than him. She dips him when they kiss. He’s still wearing two shirts. It’s freaking sweet.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Goblinchasers get into their coveralls. Everybody talks about twinkies, again. And then boom - they’re chasing the sweetest Goblins of all. Right when they show up at the Roman Roof party this boss goblin who is a lot like Grace Jones but is also not Grace Jones shows up and turns the Housesitter and the Locksmith back into the Demon Dogs.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So Vanman is super upset, because he thought he was dating Debs, because men, and she’s a dog now. Nobody really knew Two-Shirts so he has no mourning period. Then Spangles is like, “oh, damn, we should cross lasers.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Every other Goblinchaser is like, “The heck you say?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Spangles just nods and is like, “it could work, dummies.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So they blast the Grace Jones look alike and she jumps into the clouds like lightning.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Grace Jones, who is now the clouds asks, “choose your destroy package.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While everybody gets crazy about clearing their heads and picking the right destroy persona Rick thinks about summer camp and roasting freaking mallows on a stick.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The city shakes and rumbles, and out of the depths of hell steps the sailor mallow man, a freaking 400 foot marshmallow. He’s smiling and then also breathes fire and just like the Locksmith and the Housesitter can turn his eyes into fiery red demons and laser beam the world.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Goblinchasers have no problem burning the Sailor mallow man - it takes like three freaking seconds and the whole city is covered in scrumptuous mallow. While everybody eats the mallow stuck to their heads and shoulders the Goblinchasers dig the freaking Locksmith and the Housesitter out of the rubble, and how freaking sweet is this: they’re their regular selves. Everybody kisses lips and the city lives off all the delicious goo forever! Win-Win has a serious I love this friggin' town kind of moment and throws a whole pack a smokes down the gullet! Freeze frame!</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mug spends most of her days bathed in lamp’s golden light. Lamp’s bulb casts mug’s shadow all across desk and sometimes against keys. It wasn’t always this way.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mug sat on shelf in the white light of the cold store. There she watched men in glasses and women in hats peruse the shelves. There she saw Craig, was first held by Craig, was inspected all over by Craig. He looped a finger through her handle, cupped her bottom in his palm, lifted her up above him and swung her around. He even tossed her up and spun her there, and she heard him exhale a now familiar sound, a satisfied hum, before she was placed gently inside basket, swiped across belt, wrapped in paper and unfolded in living room.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mug saw living room first - the cool light of day casting room in blue. Then boxes came, unfolded, spilled out, and spaces were made. Craig built desk with mug on floor, filled for a moment with heat from pot’s black coffee.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It was on desk that mug first realIzed a different warmth, not the inside feeling of being full and heated, or the texture-contact embrace of Craig’s hand, the wrinkled kiss of Craig’s lips, or being emptied and placed gently into sink. Here on desk mug was light and shade, white and grey, warm in her light.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On desk mug understands Craig as he breathes out his satisfied hum. Atop desk, basking in lamp’s light, out of cabinet, away from cups and plates, mug can sit quietly staring at the dancer under the lamp. She doesn’t know her name, has no way to ask it. Mug sits in her warm light and watches her sway in the still air of the room, the dancer’s grass skirt bristling against her legs, a smile frozen across her face while her hips pause in the dance, happy always under lamp, her eyes closed, thinking of a beach somewhere.</p>

      <title>These Small Buildings</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“These small buildings shaped like different foods - I didn’t mean to, but I stepped on at least three, that’s what I’m trying to tell you!” The insect continues staring up at you as you hold it near your face. “The building shaped like a pizza, which is low to the ground there,” you point at a sand pile near your foot, “I’d say I’ve demolished a slice-sized piece of it, with the tip of my shoe.&nbsp;Completely by accident.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The ladybug on your palm looks at you and blinks.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Listen, maybe this isn’t the best time, but I wanted to know, if you don’t mind, are there small glassless windows? You ask. “And does the grass look like trees?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“How would I know what the world looks like from the inside of one of those ridiculous buildings? it asks.&nbsp;Its teeny voice is hilarious to you, but you hold back your delight.&nbsp;You also decide not to confuse things by asking how this ladybug acquired such an adorable British accent.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You stumbled upon this tiny village after taking the jog that you’ve just finished.&nbsp; Your dreams last night were full of blasts of color from peculiar places, paint splattered houses, and there were more balloons than usual.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well, I just assumed-“</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You just assumed that all bugs go into all buildings that are bug-sized is that it?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes,” you say letting out a hiccup of a laugh, “I guess I -”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And you probably think we whistle while we work or something as well?” asks the Ladybug, with a humph, now sitting upright and crossing its ladybug arms across its black belly.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Listen, I was just trying to apologize.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Apologize to the ants.&nbsp;I haven’t any time for it.”&nbsp;You don’t like the ladybug’s attitude very much, and you, having decided to do what you can for its world through what may be a ridiculous apology, are quite frustrated that this little speck has been so rude to you.&nbsp; How could you have known that stumbling atop a pretzel shaped mound of dirt would end in the audible screams of tens of six-legged little critters.&nbsp;At least you now know it was ants; the Ladybug has served its purpose.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Does it hurt when you are flicked?” you ask.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“When I’m flicked?” asks the Ladybug, its body tilted, its brow furrowed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes,” you say, “like this,” and you flick the little fucker away.&nbsp; You rest your hands on your hips and take in a deep breath, still a bit winded from your run. A grasshopper lands in the crux of your forearm, light as air. You raise the creature close to your face.&nbsp;The grasshopper is wearing a monocle over its left eye and in one of its front most appendages it holds a very small cookie.&nbsp;The Grasshopper takes an impossible nibble and asks you with a mouthful of emptiness, “You need help?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You are delighted that this V-legged thing too has a British accent.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“These buildings, which I believe belong to the ants-</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Go on,” it urges.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I believe I destroyed about three of them.”&nbsp; The grasshopper slaps a free appendage to the cloth of your t-shirt as it exclaims, “They’ll never miss it!” The bug laughs out hysterically at this, which makes you laugh. The sudden movement of your body startles the grasshopper to hop away.&nbsp;You yell out for him to please come back.&nbsp; Within moments he does.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I saw what you did to the ladybug, you understand.” You smile wide, taking in the insect’s wondrously small voice.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What will you wash your cookie down with?” you ask.&nbsp;The grasshopper shrugs and says, “I’ll think of something. What’d that Ladybug do to get you to give him the old finger,” the grasshopper prods with a curious smile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The Ladybug was rude.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh the lads will have a laugh at this,” it squeals.&nbsp;You laugh again too, delighted that the Grasshopper is in such high spirits.&nbsp;You are about to ask if the Grasshopper has a name when he interrupts, “Listen Mate, better be off, look who’s on his way back!”&nbsp;The Grasshopper digs its tiny feet into your skin and bounces away, sending a trickle up your arm from the sensation.&nbsp;The Ladybug approaches with a Worker Bee who is at best disinterested to be a part of the escalating situation.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As they draw nearer they stop and hover in the air.&nbsp;You overhear the Worker Bee describe that in using its stinger, it then wastes its ability to guard the Queen, which, it assures the Ladybug, is a Worker Bee’s first priority.&nbsp;You hear the Ladybug protest, reminding the Bee of the use of your finger.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We insects have to look out for one another!” it pleads.&nbsp;The Bee ponders this for sometime, twisting its small head back and forth between the Ladybug and you.&nbsp; It utters some sort of apology to the Ladybug and flies away, leaving the red and black-shelled insect disgraced and alone.&nbsp;You blurt out that you are sorry as the Ladybug slowly flies away, this time of its own volition, but you are too late and now you both feel ashamed.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You bend down to look closely at the village that the ants have constructed, you think about the peculiar choices made in choosing their shapes, of the tiny ant architect who drew up the plans.&nbsp;You wonder what the ants do in the popsicle-stick shaped building.&nbsp;You imagine an ant-training course in the building that is shaped like a coffee bean. How long will it take them to fully excavate what is left of the half eaten cupcake they are currently hauling from over the varios ridges to the pleated paper holder. You think of the industriousness of these ants, of all that you could do with those extra two arms.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The only housing you can remember for ants are crude hills and the plastic man-made farms. They were light as air when you lifted them, like a piece of paper in your small hands.&nbsp;You want to be told that this place is a sacred one, that these foods that they've replicated here with the dirt are their gods, that this is a place of worship.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The building at the center of this village shaped like a chocolate bar is the government, you’re sure, with its perfectly cut squares, divided by public walkways: paths to the forest of grass outside the city-center.&nbsp;This is where they would convict you for crushing buildings mindlessly and where you would offer to rebuild to no avail.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A black fly in the distance buzzes in circular patterns like a miniature lawn mower cutting the air.&nbsp;You try to remember how many eyes they have, that looking through a fly eye is like looking through a kaleidoscope.&nbsp;Kaleidoscope.&nbsp;You picture the object: looking inside it to find a collision of color.&nbsp;You think of erosion.&nbsp;You picture the slow movement of dirt and the indestructible bodies of these small creatures in a cyclical tumble just like the colored stones in the ocular lens.&nbsp;Crushing them is effortless.&nbsp;But they craftily dodge the movement of earth in waves.&nbsp;The ants, like foxes, constantly outwit the moving dirt.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You begin to think that you probably didn't kill anything.&nbsp;And then you remember the piercing tin-screams, all treble.&nbsp;You imagine the ladybug huge, and how terrifying its underbelly is as it approaches you.&nbsp;You imagine being dismembered, pulled apart, by legs in groups of six.&nbsp;You remember feeding crickets to lizards in glass cages in your parent's giant wood house.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You approach a line of ants doing some heavy lifting. You bend down and get very close.&nbsp;But before you can bring up the pretzel shaped building, or the pizza shaped building or find out if ants too speak with British accents, a deafening thunder erupts above you.&nbsp;A single giant cloud hangs over your house about one hundred yards away.&nbsp; The cloud has no top, it continues skyward as far as you can see and it constantly spreads.&nbsp;There is movement from within the cloud, and another horrible rumble shakes the ground.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The ants are scrambling in a fury away from you.&nbsp;Even in a panic their movements are controlled - they move in tight formations, in orderly rows.&nbsp;In your shadow their perfect black bodies bounce the reflection of what light remains in the sky at your face.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The idea of the approaching rain makes you feel stupid for even considering an apology.&nbsp;The ants will be swallowed whole by single raindrops.&nbsp;The last thing on their tiny minds will be the tennis shoe that clumsily crushed their primary school, which, of course, is what the pizza shaped building is.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You feel a hard sting on your leg and you quickly slap your hand hard against your calf muscle.&nbsp;It is the Worker Bee. You watch it helplessly flutter its wings and kick its still functioning appendages.&nbsp;The rain falls hard.&nbsp;As the dirt polka-dots with wet spots you look up towards your house.&nbsp;You lay your entire shoe-length in to the pizza shaped building distracted in the moment. You remember two things as you quicken your pace to your farmhouse so many more yards ahead. The windows are open. You are allergic to bees.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Turgle pulled the lever and this is the unfinished skin that came out. The Doctor says, “It didn’t cook long enough.” The Pelican nurse is shaking her beak. Turgle, all chrome and spherical, is covered in green drips, frozen in place, that feel like sponged plaster. He’s touching his left claw to his jowls, shaking his head.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Sally don’t like the look of Turgle now,” says Turgle to the Doc. They were meant to be wed. “It’s slime season now.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Ain’t that bad, Turgle,” says the Doc. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Then why ain’t Sally saying them things?” Sally folds her wings across her chest. Turgle pictures her sticking her beak up the way she does when she tosses a big fish and slides it head first down the gullet. “You’re graceful, my lovebird,” says Turgle, “you’re all grace.” Sally darts her beak toward the door, looking away from her fresh-skinned robot fiance.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’m gonna lift the mirror up to you slow like, Turgle,” says the Doc.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I don’t need to see it Doc. I can see it all over her face.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The bird exits the room. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You sign up to get slimed, and the sliming never stops.” Turgle rests his drippy green face in his claws. “It’s one big friggin’ cycle. Folks don’t change, ma would say that ‘til it bounced off the wall. But that was about dad. That was always about dad, in a cross armed stance, leaning against a door jam, cigarette ash hanging long off the filter, between her lips.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Ain’t as bad as you think,” says the Doc. “Lemme show you something.” The Doc slips out a leather briefcase and inside it is a stack of old comic books. Atop the pile is <em>The Creature from the Deep Sea</em>. “Look here, you see this guy,” the Doc points his finger to the guy’s face. “He got gills and these big lips here.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Turgle swipes the comic in his claw. He tilts his head as he takes in the scene: the creature with sad eyes creeps along the shoreline. Fires blaze above the waters in the distance, as if his people were out there in the deep sea in danger from underwater explosions and above water oil spills. There are oil-soaked birds like his beloved stretching their black wings on the beach. The world needs to be extinguished from the pains blazing in and around it. It’s swollen to bursting.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I gotta go,” says Turgle. “I need to keep this. I need to show her.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh, that’s a very rare,” says the Doc, but he stops there, caught in Turgle’s electric-white gaze, the robot’s new eyes wide and piercing, he grips the book in his claw. No other words are spoke, the slime monster chases his bird.<br></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Seventeen minutes and I scale that tree. I know how long it takes for those monkeys to move on. And I’m not getting tossed at today. I use tiger claws and scale right up. I have tiger claws, I am tiger claws. I got seventeen reasons to climb that tree and everyone of ‘em ends with coconuts. I’m a thirsty jungle cat. All a jungle cats are a thirsty jungle cats.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I chomped a human man at a wrist once. Coughed up a wrist watch and gnawed on a finger bones. Made me think of a not-so-tough claw. Made me think he’d better move away from my jungle, gave ‘em something to remember me by. Pretty kitty, is what she said. And she don’t think that way no more.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I dream my world is electric, every tree a ball of yarn. We don’t have to be domestic to know the feel of a soft ball of endless weaves is a good to scratch and chase. In my dreams the coconuts fill the trees and I pounce from one to the next in a hop-off style.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The other cats are no match for me. I lick a hurt paw and turn a quick neck to snatch a small rat and pounce to a next bark.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Birds are tasty snacks. I like a feather tickle down my deep throat. I like to prowl at night in the fluorescent water, watch the silver plankton skip across the surface in their glow party. I like to open my jaws wide and make a boat propeller out of my cat-tail. I swoop a lot of tiny fish in my jungle mouth, then I chomp chomp the whole lot in a jaw snap. I like a feel a plankton squish between my sharp teeth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In my next dream I am a clawless kitty. I gotta use my whole mouth to scale a tree and my cat-tail to find balance. I catch my body’s reflection in a crystal water of a lake after I roll across a tan sand in a full body spiral. I think I am a hungry jungle. I think I am a gust of wind. I see my open mouth and am wondering if my jaw can stretch wider than this. I wonder if this is a smile or a growl face that I make when I dip my open mouth into a water. I wonder how many stupid fish will swim in. A face is what you make it. You can make a any face.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I’ll sharpen each claw on a nearby rock everyday while I wait. Then I’m up a tree fast, so fast you can barely see my electric light. Time’s up.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lady tried to kill rat for weeks. Poison. Trap. Knife, once, though the thought of close contact and clean up disturbed her greatly. She spent many long dark hours awake, hearing squeaks in the plaster, claws against the drywall. She stayed up late night watching comedy shows with the volume high, so she could listen from her kitchen perch, hanging out the window, seeing how long the ash on each cigarette would grow before it snapped off, falling to a crumble against the iron slats of the fire escape, then straight through those slats into air. All the while rat hardly tried to hide.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She replaced her clothes with a box at night, to sleep through the night unafraid. She kept her head hidden in a hood, under an embroidered veil. She painted her face to scare the thing away. She used brooms and sticks to chase it. Rat persisted. A recent canvas dried over on her easel. She could not create in this environment. Rat would come out of whatever crack in the wall it was near. It would sit and stare at her from a perch atop the floor. Lady would watch rat, to the soundtrack of the nightly news, an old movie, a late-night talk show. Rat would watch lady.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Late one night, coming in from a work function with enough tequila for two nights sleep, lady found rat standing upright on the center of her living room rug. Its front paws were dangling in front of its small, slim, round body. “My name is Eileen, rat,” said the woman loudly. “You have a name?: She lit a cigarette, stood framed in the backlight of the hall under her open door frame, a silhouette save for the burning embers at the stick’s tip.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Rat approached Eileen’s foot and looked up at her with its head cocked. She stuck her pointer finger out slowly, like a dancer’s leg taking a long pronounced step and smacked it against the cigarette flinging her customary trail of ash, and a lit ember down at rat, piercing its body. The animal emitted a shrill shriek and scampered away. Eileen went to bed listless, she tossed and turned all night.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She awoke, plainly clothed, outside her vail and box. Her head throbbed. Her feet ached. Rat was gone. She looked beneath the bed, in the kitchen, from room to room, no rat. She lit a cigarette and sat looking down at her familiar view, not a claw against the drywall, not a squeak from any wall.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Time passed. Eileen came home later at night. She hardly used the kitchen at all. The smell of cigarettes lifted from the apartment. Her sleeping box was placed inside her wardrobe, her vail was hung on a bedpost. She washed her face before bed and left it this way until morning. She spoke to someone on the phone at night. She laughed and curled her tongue, touching it to her teeth while kicking a leg up.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On an otherwise ordinary Wednesday the door slammed open. Eileen was abruptly pinned to the door by a man who smothered her with his mouth, his hands searching her body in desperation. They moaned. She pointed towards her bedroom. She took off his shirt. He took off her leggings and underwear. They sang a song of grunts. When rat appeared on the bedside table the man jumped up on both feet. He yelped. Eileen calmly said, “oh, wait, no, that is just the rat that lives in the walls. It is a harmless thing.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I,” the man paused here, standing atop her mattress, to take in the ease at which this woman referred to this rat, “have to leave.” Eileen did not protest. She stood, bottomless, and crossed her arms as he buttoned his shirt, the cool air raised bumps along her legs. She leaned over to her bedside table, her hand nearly grazing rat, to grab her stacked cigarettes and lighter. Before she was through lighting and inhaling the first drag, the male guest was gone.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Looks like it’s you and me, rat,” Eileen said to the rodent, who cocked its head in a familiar way. “I burned you didn’t I?” She stood staring at the thing, her elbow bent, palm up, cigarette dangling between her fingers. Rat watched the smoke form a thin trail to the ceiling. “C’mon then,” she said as she motioned toward the kitchen. She opened the window to the fire escape, sat at her perch. “For a moment there, I thought he’d stay. But he wasn’t somebody that would stick around too long, either way.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The next day Eileen drew the upper part of an oval from the base of the drywall in her living room. She drilled a hole and carved the shape out from there. It was the size of rat, looked like something she’d seen in a cartoon once. The animal crawled its way out when she was finished. It sat in its usual way, paws hanging in front of its belly.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Her sleep cycle regulated. She carved a hole in the box she used to sleep in for the animal to feel welcome, though she only wore it around the house in a casual manner, now. She went back to her window sill at night, the cigarette ash grew long again before she let it break and fall.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It was through her routine that she noticed how still rat could be, while it watched her. She followed rat’s movements, the way its left paw always led, the way its hind legs raised high above its body as it crept along the apartment. She moved her easel to the kitchen, fed the thing cheese, grapes, water. Its portrait came naturally, a small sized canvas, for her, half a meter wide. She hung it outside the entrance to her kitchen.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Using a compact mirror and a stretched six centimeter square canvas she painted her own image too. Above the carved entryway to rat’s wall she hung the painting of her face, framed in gold, looking out across the living room. Late at night she turned out the lights as the click-clicks of rat’s claws tapped after her from room to room. When she closed her eyes to go to sleep, she listened to rat leave her doorway, she followed its quiet movements, she could approximate its stopping place, outside its own entryway, curled up facing her portrait.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Oh this? This is a lemon. My tree fruit. I climbed to get it. Black and white bears climb. I taught my daughter to climb as well. Humans think we sit mostly. But we roll and we tumble. We can be clumsy, and sure, we like to eat, but we’re also very fierce. I had two babies. One baby ate the other baby. Though my love for my baby was very strong, I still wanted to eat her for eating her brother. I named her Shēngcún. She likes the lemons that we find in the trees.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A long time ago when I was young I fell from a tree and hurt my back. I spent a very long time thinking about trees and falling while staying on the ground. Then my mother was eaten by a crocodile because we were too close to its swamp. I didn’t think about it in the moment, but before I knew it I was up very high in a tree. I looked down only once to confirm whether my mother got away. She did not. The crocodile didn’t seem interested in me at all. I found my way from tree to tree until I felt that it was safe to climb back down.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I was taken I didn’t have a chance to run. I was hungry. <em>Starving</em>, is what the humans kept saying. I was very tired. This is how I met my mate. He was a gruff panda. Never a kind word to say. But the humans positioned us in a way that made sex impossible to ignore. We were our only options. They kept placing us in tight quarters. They practically put him inside me. At the time it was all very distressing but then I had my babies growing. Then my babies lived out in the world with me. Then there was only one.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This lemon is what I remind Shēngcún to chew when she wants to clear her head of this world. If you bite down on its insides the tingling sensation that spreads to the outer portion of the jaw is euphoric. This is like being chased, where you want to escape but you also don’t want to stop running. Your jaw tingles, and you press your tongue deep into the base of your mouth to find some fluid reserve to combat the tartness of the fruit. I tell Shēngcún this all the time. I tell her this is how I find my bliss. This is how I remember to forget.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Oh, I have a special door. Wherever I place it, it takes me where I want to go. I’ve dreamt of visiting Shangri-la, because my dad played it in a song. When he rested my door along the wall, we opened it together and guess what we saw? A paradise sprawled along a city street, across the road was sprawling green. All my favorite animals were there, among the trees, sipping tea, singing the song my dad liked to play.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The strangest thing I’ve ever seen is when I visited the deep blue sea. I opened the door and there afloat, I sat in a box-like boat. I stared out at the endless waves looking for fish, sharks, and whales, but for as far as I could see there was only water, water and me. I waved hello to the waves and they smacked against my door’s wooden box. The strange part was even though it was the prettiest thing I’d ever seen, I was alone, in the glistening sea, and the sound of wind grew fierce around me, and I only wanted one thing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I stepped out of my special door and asked dad to hold me. He asked if I was okay and I explained there is a monster in the building across the way. He asked me what it looked like and I told him it is a red one, with yellow teeth. Also it has yellow hair, eyes, and sleeves. Then I asked to see my friends, who were gathered with things to eat. I told them about the monster, that it’s quiet as the sea, and that it’d be best if we all sleep in a ball together, under my softest sheets.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I asked my dad that night in bed, to put my special door in the shed. I said I am not ready to leave my world, I don’t think I know it enough yet. He said, “all right my sweet,” and took the door before I fell asleep.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He googled the name Rodney Dangerfield. Maybe he’d heard it before. But he swore he’d come up with it. The name was taken by some geezer who made soup jokes using hats for bowls. He had bug-out eyes and looked like a creeper. He watched a clip of the geezer in bikini briefs jumping off the high-dive with some twinkling piano music in the background. The name was perfect. So he took it. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He internet browsed some more. He found out that stealing a car was a big crime. He found out they’d taken marshmallows from his favorite cereal and replaced them with new shapes like no one would notice. He found out an eye in a pyramid meant something called divine providence. Providence meant foreseen care, under control, in this case god’s control. He decided he didn’t want god’s eye tattooed on him after all, so Rodney scrapped it from his playbook. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Providence is also a place in Rhode Island. The shape of this place also was unappealing to get needled into his skin. He searched for the word red and came up with a pile of things. Apples, roses, poppies, lips, fingernails, heart-shaped sunglasses, yield signs. He googled yield signs which led to caution signs. He googled caution signs which led to radiation signs. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Rodney wanted to steal plutonium. He wanted to get to the past with the knowledge of the future. He wanted to jump in a backwards machine and take over the crumb-life he’s adapted to. He’s got a crumb-job and a crumb-house and he’s done with crumbs. Plus, what was all the split-training for if not for bank-robs and society-mixers? He can split in any pants’ legs in a flat line so his package taps the floor. He used to split naked on the sand until a starfish stuck to his inner thigh and he made a forever pet. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He named the starfish Len. He took him everywhere in a slightly watered resealable sandwich bag. He stole a pair of cargo shorts so Len could have some room to wiggle in a thigh pocket. They had high-octane adventures, but Len requested, no more splits. The jolt of movement was a world shatterer for a pocket starfish and he was over the tight squeeze from the fabric tension against Rodney’s leg. Rodney fed Len burger portions ripped into perfect bites. The starfish stole soda from a crushed can. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Backwards machines are mostly old cars, Google says. They’re always powered by radiation. Rodney thought a yellow space suit would be a sweet way to announce himself to the old world. They’d think alien, but he’d tell them, I’m just your grandson, turkeys. Maybe he could go back far enough to be the OG Dangerfield. He could steal the name and the soup joker would need another, or be the forever runner-up to Rodney’s big number one. Rodney orders a belt with his first adopted name on it. It shows up two days after he gets the radiation symbol tattooed on his left wrist. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Rodney found out going back in time is a forever pursuit, and that he’d better just rob a bank in real time with a bag of snakes like they used to do. He’ll let the snakes loose, then he’ll make his strange move, where he says he saw a snake sneak into a back room. He’ll show people his tattoo, then they’ll let him through to do his thing. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Rodney couldn’t purchase the quantity of snakes that he wanted to rob the bank, so he went to the tackle shop and swooped up their longest worms. When he let the mud sling at the bank a small thud smooshed against the floor tiles. The worms just sort of twisted in place, rotating their weird bodies and twisting their floppy necks. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Len was running out of water and Rodney was getting a neck sweat. He let out a high squeal and yelled that the snake pile on the floor was full of danger. People started to giggle. A twerp held a phone up and started filming.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When the cops came the phone kid pointed at Rodney and said he’s trying to steal. The cops raised their guns at Rodney, and said, “Dangerfield, hands up, head on the ground.” On his way down a cop jumped at him into a tackle. He watched the mud slush pile twist its tentacles while his cheek pressed into the floor.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What’s your name kid? Asked the fuzz.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He said, Crumb, Rob Crumb. And the cops said let’s go Dangerfield, and they carried the sucker out in cuffs.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“My prickles are almost all prigged.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You’ve been scared many times.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah, we both have.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“By the light of the moon.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes. By its light, dog.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Purglepine thinks about his prickles, spinning the daisy he plucked between the tips of his claw. <em>What happens</em>, he wonders, <em>when the prickles are all prigged.</em> </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You will be free,” whispers a low, unfamiliar voice.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Dog, did you?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Did I what?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I thought I heard something.” Dog scratches a loose-hanging prickle behind her ear. She scrapes it clean off, and saddened by this curls into a ball under a stump. A crack of a branch in the woods startles them. Both creatures dart their heads towards the sound. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Just a branch</em>, the Purglepine thinks, <em>and what is free anyways? </em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Free,” whispers the voice.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Where are you? Asks Purgle. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’m here,” says dog.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Purgle walks a few steps into the clearing, feeling the bright light of the moon on him. He extends his arm, looks at all the holes left from his prickles. <em>These used to be such strong arms</em>. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They are still strong,” says the voice. “They are just unprotected.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Where is that voice happening</em>, thinks Purgle. He looks at dog, folded into herself, having not heard the voice at all. <em>Why will I be free?</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You will be free,” says the voice, “because you will no longer worry about having enough, or not having enough, you will be what is left, after prickles, beyond worry.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Do you think I worry too often?</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You are worried, right now. You are worried about a branch in the woods. You are worried about the question you’ve asked me. You are worried that you are talking to yourself.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Am I talking to myself? </em>The moon drifts down in the night sky almost out of site. With its descent the forest grows darker, colder. The Purglepine watches his breath while the gentle breathing of sleeping dog hums nearby.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You are not talking at all,” says the voice. “You are wondering, and listening. This is a wonderful thing you figured out, without question.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>I didn’t want to bother dog.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You have each other, even when neither of you have prickles.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>I miss them, the feeling of scraping against a tree. There are so few left to rub against bark or lift up and down with a roll of my shoulder. </em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But you remember them. You remember each one. In remembering they each can serve you when you are too full of wonder. Each prickle lost is a guide.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Are you a guide?</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No,” whispers the voice, “I am lonely too, sometimes. I could hear you very loudly tonight, so I thought I would say hello.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Will I see you again? </em>wonders the Purglepine, squinting his eyes to see his daisy.<em> &nbsp;</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Always,” whispers the voice, as the forest goes dark.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Brittle and Chorb were out searching the mud bog for mouth spiders when the dust fog rolled in. They’d been gathering for hours, losing sight of their limbs in a low cloud when they bent over, submerging them into the mud. Chorb’s tentacle was tickling the back of a plump morsel when the light shockingly beamed in their direction. The dust fog was alive and bright, a billion critters swirled in the thick particle whisps searching for a host. They’d probably only collected twenty mouth spiders each before the sudden pull towards the electromagnetic glow. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> It was a white light, the kind to be avoided, to look away from, to not go towards. They’d heard the stories, had themselves imagined yelling the words to others in moments of peril. And yet on they seemed to slide towards it, Chorb because he had no legs to begin with, and Brittle because his waist seemed to lead the way, he barely lifted his legs other than to raise his feet from the thick mud below. Tree shapes crawled across their faces like fingers and claws reaching out for them. The mouth spiders spun furious webs inside the pillowcase-sacks they used to catch them, chasing the shadows like they were something to hold onto. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Brittle thought about the loose thread holding his forehead skin together, thought about wasting a mouth spider on himself, letting it crawl around his brain and patch the gaps with its nature-caulk. But his hands were fixed to his sides, his feet the only part of his body moving. Plus the payment they’d get for twenty was a lot more than what they’d each get for nineteen. Nobody liked an ugly number at the latch factory.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Chorb laid a green layer of slick ooze over the mud bog. The glow of his slime trail submerged slowly into the mud forming ground stars that twinkled beneath the fog. Before they disappeared the skittle beetles chased the twinkles like drunken thirsties, itching for a nip. Chorb noticed a new inability to close his mouth. He could feel stray beetles sneaking their way onto his tongue and draining it of its moisture.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Brittle’s face too had begun to freeze in place, which led the corners of his mouth to stretch, his eyes to widen, his pupils to dilate to their tiniest selves. He tried to motion to Chorb by lifting his arm, but all he could manage was a single thumb joint wiggle that went unseen. The light sucked them in closer to whatever its center was. Chorb’’s tentacle seemed frozen in place around his oldest friend’s arm. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They are both thinking about the eerie similarity between feeling frozen in this magnetic light with a conversation they were having in the latch factory two days prior. Chorb was pulling his lever while Brittle pulled his lever, next to one another on line eleven, like always. They enjoyed pulling their levers simultaneously, to add their element to each latch in unison and place them into their pneumatic tube so that the air made one perfectly timed suction pull as both their canisters disappeared up in a race skyward. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Standing next to each other they laughed at the idea that if they were to perform this action (which they worked to perfect daily, and were often milliseconds off in their execution) absolutely flawlessly that their tubes would break, that maybe actual time in the world would stop. Their eyes widened at the idea of this, time stopping, and them crawling through a frozen landscape of the living, far away from levers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The dust fog thins as the bright white light’s heat intensifies. They are now very near to the source. The two old friends are frozen in a state of fear, making the faces of two upright things omitting loud screams, yet all the sound left are the beetles wings as the insects dart between the gaping mouths. Larger than either Chorb or Brittle, the shape of the light up close is wide and circular. Though neither can confirm it, the light seems to now lift them fully out of the muck. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As sudden as an eyelid flick the two friends find themselves floating, within the light. Around them everywhere is the bright white, there is no tether or pull, no entryway or exit, blank, nothingness. A neon green drip lifts off of Chorb’s tail and it too just hovers among their bodies, a part of whatever the nothingness and everything they are now apart of. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Are we the shadows of the trees? Are we the trees? Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear everything? Everything you are thinking, I am thinking to. Hey, you just moved your mouth. You just moved your mouth too! Did you speak? No did you? No. We are together. We are lucky to be together. I should smile. I should smile. It feels good. It is good. Are we dead? I cannot say. What is the feeling? Where are the mouth spiders? Your skin is coming undone. Of course. Oh. Oh. Release the mouth spiders. Yes! Let them form a web. Yes! That is like the beginning. Yes! Yes! The web will be how it begins. This is how we begin in the light!</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong>OGRE.</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ogre lives in a windowless hut, under a grass hill, near a narrow stretch of a long and winding brook. Though his species is diurnal, Ogre protests the sunlight by force of habit, usually waking late in the day and not finding bed until nearly dawn</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Routine. He wakes and cracks a dozen eggs, whips them furiously in a blender with ice, adds the squeezings of three oranges, and a pint of heavy cream. &nbsp;On Wednesdays he is careful not to kill the dairy farmer from whom he demands his milk, or the orange farmer, from whom he accepts weekly carriage fulls of the bright, juicy orbs. In a display of what he considers great kindness Ogre even pays the iceman for two bricks when he makes his rounds. This luxury is new, and he finds immense pleasure in gnawing the cold chunks. He doesn’t want to imagine a life without the otherworldly cold filling his throat. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After breakfast he grooms himself on his toilet. He sits for an hour and sharpens his claws and teeth with a metal chisel. He removes a strip of twine from the ball in the water closet and flosses out any stringy bits of leftover meat. He wraps a fur garment under and over him and spritzes a splash of wormwood over his wrists. He smells of bark and always has, he attributes many of his fastidious kills deep in the woods to this.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A sophisticate. He lines his shelves with cooking books and fills his drawers with utensils. He thinks often about preparing meals, but mostly he sleeps. He wakes in time to welcome his egg shake with a stein of beer. The beer always leads to several more, then Ogre’s lethargy sinks in, stealing his motivation to peel and cut the root vegetables needed for a hearty broth or soup. More so, by the time he stumbles out of bed, his head often blurred from whatever trouble he started the yesterday before, it is dark. When he opens his hut door he can hear the sounds of hooves flopping against dirt, pulling the farmers’ wagons away. He knows he cannot get the vegetables he needs to begin a big dish without a pillage, and by the time he realizes all of this, he is too hungry to think about preparation. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Under cover of night he relents, often very drunkenly, finds it is easiest to hastily chomp up a human without making much of a scene than plunder a whole local farm. A snapped neck or two, his dozen eggs and cream, a couple barrels of beer. The nights are his days. The days lost to his nights. A stash of rootberry twigs stave off any pre-dawn cravings, settle his stomach before the midday sun cooks his hut enough to awaken him again.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One night, having chomped a thin man to bits, angrily spitting out the foul meat the dead man offered from his bones Ogre is struck with a violent stomach pain. He balls his hands to fists and pounds against his midsection. The pain is an ugly knot inside him. He finds a barrel of coffee beans from the dead man’s cellar. If the pain won’t leave on its own, he’ll chase it out. Ogre hand grinds all of the beans and brews a mighty cauldron of dark liquid. He guzzles the scolding pot down. His eyes twitch. His fingers shake. He punches the glass windows of the dead man’s house. He snaps twigs in the woods. A sudden quake and rumble stop him in his tracks. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The sun is rising as Ogre is finally rid of the dead man’s rot. With his system finally in repair, a starving sensation sets in. He slides his brick of a hand under a pile of wet leaves, scoops up a fresh and wiggling pile of worms, chews the worms, soil and all, into a satisfying mud. Then, a bell rings in the distance. The market is open. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ogre happily stomps his way through the awakening woods, damp leaves and wet twigs under his feet. He taps his hands against his belly, excited to run his plump fingers through the offerings. He can smell cooked onion in the distance, the sounds of market chatter, the song of proud voiced tenor accompanying a lute. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As he reaches the forest clearing the Ogre feels the warmth of the morning sun on his pale skin. The flesh covered by his fur wrap is heating up and he is thirsty. He’ll visit the wine merchant first, then he’ll peruse the vegetables. Looking up, he sees their watchful eyes. Of course the humans freeze upon seeing him step into the light, his sharp teeth poking up and over his hidden upper lip. He twists his thick lower lip into a smile, then curtsies to the onlookers, extending one of his hairy arms out daintily, an offering of peace. The crowd starts to life again, though they each keep an eye on the demon in their midst.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ogre fills a rucksack with onions, beets, carrots, and ginger. He stomps briskly between stands, each merchant throws their vegetables in quickly for fear that they themselves will be pulled into the sack. Ogre belches loudly after a cold stein from a fresh tap. He laughs heartily, resting his hand on the brewer’s shoulder, the man’s body buckling from Ogre’s weight, nodding up at the monster fearfully. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I not gonna eat you, sir,” says Ogre, “but I am like to visit you brewery sometimely.” The brewer nods. “It okay, not to fear from me, I am already eaten. And what more, I is mood for soup, anyhow. Sure, surely, I like a taste a human meaty, but not one so import as you. Oh, <em>look</em>, a dragon.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ogre nearly knocks the brewer down as he rushes to a lizard bathing in sun on a rock. “What dragon this?” he demands, blinking a great deal and unable to fight back a wide and unpleasant looking grin. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“‘Tis a lizard sir,” says an old man. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Not dragon?” asks Ogre.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“‘Tis - a lizard. Sir. Feeds mostly on crickets.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I will have it.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Lizard’s not for sale, sir.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I take it. Or, eat you and take it.” The man quickly raises the wide flat rock with the lizard atop it up to Ogre. “Oh, goody.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I call it Peepaw.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I like this. I call it that too.” Ogre adjusts his rucksack, stomps away. The human merchants stop to watch the Ogre thunder off like a child with a new toy, his arms raised straight in front of him, holding the rock, staring at the lizard who remains still, its eyes closed. </p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong>LIZARD</strong>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lizard, on its rock, is placed in the center of the hut floor as the giant beast falls exhausted into his straw bed. This long last night has pushed his massive body to its limit. Ogre falls into a deep sleep around midday. The moist cool of the hut awakens Lizard, it darts its head back and forth, disoriented, and dissatisfied with the chill of the room. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While the pur of Ogre’s snore vibrates the mud floor puddles Lizard crawls off his flat rock to explore the hut. It thinks of the scents of its master, of warm tea and green plants that line the open windows of his paper house. The Lizard surveys this new sleeping master, from head to tail Lizard is roughly one foot’s length of the giant. In the blue lines of the dark hut Lizard traces the curly hairs that spring off the shoulders of the breathing beast. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sun. Lizard’s routine is wake, go to rock, adjust position to maximum exposure, close eyes, and let sun warm its back. Lizard’s heavy eyelids are not meant to stay open for long. When master rustles the paper walls of his house’s windows Lizard knows to open its eyes. This is when crickets scurry across its rock. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Crickets sing one word songs, crying “help, help, wait, help,” in a chorus of frantic chirps as Lizard darts its tongue out and collapses each twiggy body into its crooked mouth. Lizard loves a spasmic leg kick of a helpless cricket against its lower lip. He likes to press the cricket bodies up against the roof of its mouth raising its tongue slowly, until they twitch no more. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Could they converse, Ogre and Lizard would find much joy in their respectful bloodlettings. But they cannot converse, and so once Lizard realizes that the sun is likely setting outside, reading the temperature change in the room from damp and cold to even colder still, it curls itself into a tight ball, hoping the night is quick. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lizard is drawn to the sun. It wakes at dawn from some deep set internal clock. Ogre is still asleep. It clops its way to the hut door, claws and scratches to be let out. Lizard’s attempts against the wood grain do not register to the Ogre. Lizard pisses in protest on the floor, a smoke trail of steam rising of the small puddle. Then it lets out a terrifying squelp, a violent and piercing alarm which at last rouses Ogre. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What is it?” says Ogre sitting upright on his straw bed. Lizard, at the door tilts its head at the giant and again lets out a squelp so loud Ogre’s left eyelid twitches closed. Again the thing frantically claws at the door. “What is it smell like? You want out?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ogre pushes himself out of bed, his chest, stomach and crotch are covered in a thick blanket of hair. Lizard follows the body as it approaches. “Alo, Dragon,” says Ogre, leaning over and pressing his finger a little too hard against Lizard’s head. “What you want eat?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ogre opens the door and Lizard darts out the front door. Ogre shields his face from the bright morning sun, turns back to his hut and sees Lizard’s rock on the floor. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Lizard is halfway to the brook that runs across Ogre’s meadow when he hears the beast grunt its foreign sounds. Lizard looks back and sees the beast holding his warm flat rock high above his head. “Come back this way,” shouts Ogre, “I perch rock in meadow.” Though the creature doesn’t understand why, Lizard misses its rock, feels connected to it, and so turns back. </p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong>SOUP.</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ogre wakes to Lizard’s squelp. This is the third day in a row. The pattern is wearing him out. He very much likes the way the small dragon looks and darts its tongue. But this being awake in the daytime is disturbing his habits. He hasn’t had a human in days and as of last night is out of rootberry twigs. Ogre opens the door to carry the rock to the meadow again, and just as he contemplates eating his house guest, he notices his rucksack. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What say, dragon, I make a soup?” &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Without realizing it Ogre leaves the door open, and lets the light in. Moths flutter awake from a deep corner of the hut, flapping dust that twinkles across the light beam. On the shelves on the far wall of his kitchen are his books, which he has not looked at in many years. “Ah,” he says, as he marches towards them. “Alo, pretties.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ogre likes the feeling of wrapping his square hands around the blade of his knife. He likes the slipping sound of the knife cutting through the onion. He raises the glistening white insides of the vegetable up to his nose and inhales them deeply. Ogre is very pleased by this smell. He chops beets next, then several large potatoes. He smashes a head of garlic against the counter with his palm, spreading it out like a flower, its innards mashed to a paste in a single blow. When he turns he sees Lizard, sitting on its rock, its eyes closed, peacefully asleep. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When the soup is finished Ogre calls out to Lizard to come eat. The reptile&nbsp;does not respond. Ogre makes a clattering noise banging pots and pans over head. The reptile remains motionless. Ogre grips the ladle hanging on the wall and scoops up the Borscht, then stomps out into the meadow with a helping. Ogre waves the soup under Lizard’s snout. The reptile does not move. Ogre spills soup under Lizard’s head, a purple splotch seeping into the flat rock. Lizard scurries backwards and hisses at the giant. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Angry at the thing Ogre stomps his foot and lifts it by its neck. The reptile in protest pisses on Ogre’s hands. He drops Lizard, his senses awakened by the smell. “This smell, from before too. Like a fresh grass.” Ogre rubs the lizard piss into his wrists, looking up at the sun still hanging high in the sky. “I be back.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Off Ogre stomps through the woods and into the clearing, back to the market. Without pausing or offering his peaceful curtsy he makes his way to the old owner of his pet. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What my dragon eat?” asks Ogre.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“As I said sir, crickets, mostly,” says the old man. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Me can’t catch quick crickets.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Is, the lizard okay?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What your name?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Name’s Crumbell. Time to time, it’s been known to enjoy a moth.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ogre turns his wide mouth upward into a crooked smile. He blinks both his eyes slowly twice to show he is happy, making the small old man shutter. Ogre pats the man on the head with his palm and stomps away. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Ogre lights an old lantern in his hut that night and leaves his door open, allowing the moths to flutter towards the light, collecting dozens. In the morning the familiar squelp of his Lizard wakes him, but this time the thing is pressed against the lantern glass, trying to break through. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You wants a mothy, Dragon?” asks Ogre. “I’s gonna cook ‘em up nicely. Here.” Ogre lets a few moths escape and watches the reptile dart after them, snatching them with its tongue and smooshing them in its mouth. He responds with two big blinks and the wide smile. “You like ‘em. That’s good.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All day Ogre makes mothballs, squishing the flying things into a bowl with&nbsp;breadcrumbs, eggs, and gunpowder. He boils a creamy broth from curdled milk and lager. When he is finished he presents the soup to Lizard. Ogre plops down in the meadow next to the creature and its rock, ladling a puddle of mothballs for his Lizard, lifting the large cauldron high, taking large gulps for himself. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is only a matter of time before Ogre marches back to the market with a barrel of the soup in tow and Lizard on his shoulder. When the humans ask after his scent his product line grew. On occasion, Ogre rouses Lizard late in the night and takes him out in the moonlight. In the dark blue of night Ogre shows his friend the way he can snap a body in two, and then he brings Lizard to a lake where midnight crickets fly. It is a feast.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dexter, Pancho, and Val were hosting a shareholders meeting in the parlor of the Flamenco Club. This meant they were having a smoke. They called themselves a zebra stripe consortium, a plaid and polka dot sash parade, a couple of true heros leaning over a table full of dirty ash. They lit their thin cigarettes when they got there, let the smoke trails plume. They smashed their paper cups against one another and drank their gin and fizz.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Pancho was a midnight trader for a gasoline executive operating in the Philippines. He talked on the wire late into the night, mostly about smuggling slacks across party lines, state lines, countrysides. These new Wranglers were the hot commodity, these new Lees, everybody wants a piece. Pancho had a ten-percent purchase on the club, bought in flush off a hot tip and a quick turn. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dexter and Val co-owned the club in 45s. They kept Panch in on the action, because they’d grown up together and thought tethering him to the place might mean they’d see him in between disappearances. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The ash spread across their letter-shaped bakelite trays. The set was Flamingo Ps, made of Flamingo feet and necks looped round to make the letter. A blue one, a neon green, and a classic Flamingo pink. Pancho liked to ash on the flamingo beak. He liked to enter the parlor from the balcony.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You were supposed to bring the chair?” This is Val freeze-framing Pancho. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I brought this new shirt,” he flicks his shoulders and wiggles in his seat. “What chair you talking about?” The first round of paper cups are already empty. Dexter is swishing the sloe gin in a shaker. Pancho is tapping his cup rim, looking back at the fellas through the big mirror that runs the length of the whole far wall. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Listen, we all got to deal with this,” says Val.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What chair you talking about?” asks Dex.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Let ‘em come in,” says Pancho. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I don’t think it’s that simple,” says Val. Dex takes a long drag and adjusts his glasses, pulls his moppy hair behind the frames, tucked behind his ears for a second before it frees itself again. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You guys have any barretts?” asks Dex.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s that simple.” Pancho is running his finger and thumb over his moustache. “How you gonna exclude a body from the Flame?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We got a good thing, though.” Val is too passive to take a big stand. He’s getting frazzled at the thought of arguing. “We’ve been working hard on it.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Good things move, babies” says Pancho. “We can’t control this. It gets crazy we release, and start again.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I don’t want to start again,” says Dex. He jiggles the shaken gin up and the boys all lift their glasses over the table. “And hey, what’s with the chair?” &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You never really start again. This place is what we built. That part don’t change. Cool is wherever you are. We can keep it all cool. So long -”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“So long as we don’t lose it,” says Val.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s right. So long as we keep it.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Where you going?” Poncho was already straddling the window, his cup crushed on the table from a big drink, ready to exit.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’m gonna get the chair!” &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Wait wait wait, let me take a photo before you leave.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Val didn’t even look in the lens, didn’t wait for Panch to answer, didn’t look to catch an angle, just raised the camera at his side, pointed towards the wall length mirror and captured all three. Pancho would disappear in a week. But just for a moment, when none of them were looking or thinking about it, they were free.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

      <title>To Blave: A Re-tale</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2018/12/26/to-blave-a-re-tale</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong><em>To Blave: A Re:Tale</em></strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My friggin grandpa shows up on my sick day to read me a bedtime story. He smells like mothball soup and his cologne is made of farts. He’s like, hey, wanna read a book? I’m probably about to score a million points on pole position, and he’s all, “tell that game to kick rocks, you turkey,” and I’m like fine, read the friggin’ book then, you ghost. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Ok,” he says, “Once upon a time -” I already hate this book. I’m smacking palm to forehead big time. I know how freaking bad this stinker is gonna stink just on those first four words. He’s like, should I continue, and I make a thumbs down at him super hard which means <em>see if I care, you demon</em>. I fiddle with my joystick and he turns the tv off and I’m like, suck it, old man. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“There was this errand boy,” he says. Ugh, I hate this. “And he liked to fetch water and baskets and all other junk for this babe that was his mistress. And every day he leaned in super close to Lady Burgerfingers, which is what she was called, and was like, “Whatever you like,” which my grandpa says meant, <em>I love you</em>. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have to stop the old man. If this is some book sent from friggin’ smooch city I’m not having any of it. So I’m like, cool your jets and pump the friggin’ breaks. Gramps says, “cool it yourself jerko - there’s friggin’ pirates in these pages, giants, a Brazilian dagger thrower, worms of unusual length, a mathematician, and some idiot with 100 toes.” I shrug my shoulders, like, see if I care if you keep reading, you toad. ‘Cause I do sorta wanna know about those hundred toes. </p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong><em>First Part</em></strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	So, the errand boy skips town to make some big money or something to marry Burgerfingers and also prove he’s a man and not a boy. He’s pretty much instantly killed by the Dead Pirate Reynold. Grandpa’s got very little info on the Dead Pirate Reynold but apparently he’s like the head douche of the seven seas and takes no prisoners. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Burgerfingers is all mopey and agrees to marry this Prince Humpsandbumps guy in town who’s like, what do you got to lose, and she’s like, my virginity you friggin’ stooge. Prince is a stooge and he’s in a total hurry to marry Burgerfingers, so he swoops her up, and hires these three clowns to kidnap her and kill her on their wedding night. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So, a Brazilian magician, a tall man, and a big-brained, lisp-speaker called Cabeça swoop Burgerfingers kidnap style. The magician likes to play swords, talk about his dad, and about murdering the guy who murdered his dad, in the face. Tall man likes peanuts, ladies, and rhyme time. Cabeça likes silence, and riddles. They board their tiny boat, and sail to Glitter.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Glitter is the town across the way. Old Prince wants to start this big time war with the Glittarians. So his plan is to blame this kidnap of his lady, which he totes friggin’ planned, on the Glittarians and then gobble their land after murdering their peoples. He’s one of these super macho, power hungry royal dudes. A real bozo.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The kidnap party is on the high seas and the Brazilian magician just keeps talking about this boat that’s sneaking up on their crew. Cabeça is like, “that I cannot imagine.” The dagger thrower is like, “Imagine it, brains”. And the giant is like, “yeah that would keep you sane.” Their convo is cut short when Burgerfingers jumps into the water.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Lady baby,” says Cabeça, “there’s screaming water snakes in these waters, and they love eating princesses.” She’s like, “that’s B.S. brain man.” But then she hears a scream that sounds like a bat pinned under the hoof of a horse. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I stop the old man here to tell him I don’t buy it. He’s like, “you scared?” I’m like, no, you friggin’ sandwich, keep on. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A screaming water snake heads right for Burgerfingers. All the sudden a friggin’ huge fist smacks that snakey right between the eyes, dead. It’s tall-man, whose hands are humongous when he lifts the princess out of the water no-problemo. Then the Brazilian is like, “He’s even closer now.” And Cabeça is like, “That, I cannot imagine.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Everyone looks at Cabeça like, dude, he’s definitely closer. But he points ahead and says its doesn’t matter, because he’ll never catch up to us once we climb that cliff. They climb a conveniently placed rope. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You’ll never believe it,” says the dagger thrower, but this man dressed in black is climbing the rope. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“This I cannot imagine,” says Cabeça. The dagger thrower looks at the small man in disbelief of his disbelief. “We press on, you stay behind him and throw a dagger at his face.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The man dressed in black reaches the top of the cliff. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You stay to kill me?” asks the man, reaching for his sword.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Hold on,” says the dagger thrower. “I’m in no hurry to kill you. Catch your breath.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You want to play backgammon?” asks the man dressed in black. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You bet your ass I do,” says dagger man. The man dressed in black produces a small travel board with magnetic pieces from his waistband. &nbsp;“This, I cannot believe. How did you get the pieces so small.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I whittled them in a prison cell on the far side of the ocean while I awaited a trial of wrongful conviction. It is the only keepsake from that journey, I killed the judge and executioner.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I once heard a pirate story like that. You a pirate?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I am known to some as a pirate.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You are <em>Reynolds</em>, I have heard of you.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I am.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I heard you are a man who does not leave survivors.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I have no need for survivors.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Maybe we should fight after all,” says the dagger thrower. These two clowns draw swords and bang them against each other. They do flip moves, body twists, somersaults, hand tosses, and talk it up the whole time. In the middle they role dice and tend to backgammon to break up the fight. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Brazilian tells the pirate that he has trained his whole life throwing daggers in search of a 100-toed demon, to hunt him and kill him. The pirate asks what this demon did and the dagger thrower describes a great injustice. His father was a circus performer. He made the greatest daggers of all time. And the 100-toed man paid him a visit asking for a handful of these daggers. His father made him one single dagger, and when the man returned he killed him with his sword and stole all the daggers his father had. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Sounds like major revenge, dude,” said the pirate. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Totes major,” said the pirate. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I am sorry you won’t be able to finish your story, though,” said the pirate.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What are you talking about? Said the Brazilian. Then the pirate knocked him over the head with the blunt end of his sword and ran off. “I do not pity you the headache you will have when you wake, you beauty,” he shouted as he ran to catch up to the tall man and the brain. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Cabaça sees that the pirate is on their trail. He looks to his strong tall man and says, “finish him!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What do I use, a shim?” says the tall man. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Just use a rock. Beat him in the head,” says the brain. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Until he is dead?” says the tall man. The brain storms off. The tall man positions himself behind a big boulder. He throws a big stone at the pirate which crumbles against a tree. “I meant to miss,” screams the tall man. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I believe you,” says the man dressed in black. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I didn’t think it was fair,” says the tall man, “to crush you before you were here.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You are incredibly kind thieves,” says the pirate. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s just a job,” says the tall man. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Right, so, how will we do this?” asks the pirate.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Just hands,” says the tall man. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No weapons?” asks the man dressed in black. The tall man shrugs his giant shoulders. “Very well.” The man assesses the giant. “Good heavens, you’re as big as a Zepplin!” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You rhymed! That’s wonderful. I love to rhyme.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“When you have the time.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You did it again. Now I will have a hard time breaking your head.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Very good. I’ll hate to lose it,” says the pirate. “Shall we begin?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The two men wrestle. The tall man is slow and the man dressed in black is slippery. The tall man cannot grab the small pirate. The pirate slides under his arms, dips under his legs, and jumps on the tall man’s back. He wraps all of his arms round his neck until he puts the large one to sleep. “Pity to leave you here. I do not envy your headache when you wake.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is upon leaving the tall man that the pirate first sees Burgerfingers up close, the way he remembered her, because the pirate, it is now clear behind his mask, is the farmboy. He slowly approaches Cabeça, who is seated next to his blindfolded dream lady.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You best my Brazilian, so you must throw a mean dagger. And you made my tall man fall man, so you must be quite strong. But surely you are no match for my brain place.” Then Cabeça pours some wine. “Look dummy,” he says, “you poison a cup and I’ll drink the one of them sweet babies that ain’t poisoned.” The pirate nods and secretly poisons a cup.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Cabeça talks a blue streak about his smarts, about not starting a garbage war with a trash compactor, and how if a tree falls in a puddle the ocean burps a sandwich. He says something about if he said she said and we said he said then no said what said if man made no sheds. The pirate says, “stop stalling turkey, and drink your drink.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s too easy,” says the brainiac, then he drinks his drink and keels over mid laugh. Pirate face unties the princess and removes her blindfold. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Time to go,” he tells her. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Not a chance, you crab,” she says. “You stink of fish parties and the sea’s weeds.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Listen Princess,” says man dressed in black, “we got’s to get a move on before half of glitter is hot on our trail.” Then the princess pushes him over the best sledding hill in the galaxy where he goes into a wicked tumble. While tumbling into a snowball he yells out, “what-ev-er-you-like!” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“My sweet friggin’ Errand boy,” screams the princess and she dives down the snow hill after her man. </p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong><em>Second Part</em></strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	The princess is legit surprised to see the man that stands before her. He’s all mask covered and dressed in black and pretty sweetly muscular now too. She does a little eyebrow wobble checking him out. And I’m like, “hold up! Did this just turn back into a friggin’ smooch parade?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	Gramps puts the book down and does a major eyeroll at me. “Listen, dimwit,“ he says, you wanna finish, or you want to sleep until you wet the bed.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Fine,” I say, “Keep reading you friggin’ demon. You smell like twin hot dogs from last weeks meat parade.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	Some horns blow from above the hill. “Dang,” says Burgerfingers, my fiance is up there with his foot soldiers. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Let’s go party in the stank swamp.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“What? There’s shit pits in there.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Yeah, but like, we can avoid the shit pits. Don’t worry so much.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“My life has been worry.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Well, it’s time to party. So might as well start in the unknown realm of the stank swamp.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“You believe in those WOUP things?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“What,” says the pirate, “Worms Of Unusual Proportions? I hardly believe they exist.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	So these two enter the stank swamp and narrowly dodge some stank. Burgerfingers slips into a dirt pit and the pirate dives in after her. But the sandpit is too dark and deep and full of rot. And rot means one things to pirates: Worms. “Blorg! The friggin’ WOUPs are real, screams the pirate, “lookout.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	A worm of unusual proportion comes slithering up towards the lovers. It has a mouth like an anus and the teeth of a many toothed thing. It has blue-grey skin and purple follicles. All of its two sets of four eyes are closed as its pink tongue darts towards the pirate. The pirate grabs hold of that slippery tongue and he bites it clean in half with his human teeth. The WOUP makes a sound like a horse losing a hoof to a toaster made of barbed wire. The whole world shakes from the screech. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	They ride the beast up to the surface and the pirate dagger slices it into six pieces, then he quickly eats its worm heart. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Ah,” says Burgerfingers, “Why’d you eat the heart?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Always eat the heart of your enemy, princess. Every friggin’ time.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Let’s get out of here.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Ha,” says the pirate, “I was just thinking we could prolly survive a while. WOUPs are easy to kill, shit pits are easily avoidable, and we could easily just build a cabin in the trees.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Uh,” interrupts the Princess, “It smells like straight butthole in here. Let’s make haste.” &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Whatever you like,” says old farmboy, and he winks at the princess. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	Right as they exit the Stank Swamp friggin’ Prince Humpadump is there with his henchman who has a very large shoe. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“You happen to have a hundred toes on that foot,” says the Pirate.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“What do you know about it?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“I know someone looking for you.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Listen,” interrupts the prince. “We’re taking the girl, and killing you buddy.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“No,” says the princess, “you can take me, if you swear you’ll keep this sweet errand boy alive.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Cool,” says the prince. “Very cool. Will do.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Just like that?” asks Burgerfingers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Sure thing,” says the prince. “No prob.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"> So the prince takes the lady and the hundred toed man stays with the Dread Pirate Reynold. “Shall we head to where I’ll totally set you free?” he asks. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“C’mon, toes,” says the pirate, “we are men of action. Lies do not become us.” Toes thumps him on the head super hard and pirate in black fades to that. </p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong><em>Third Part</em></strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	The Brazilian gets wasted. The tall man has to rescue him before the enchanted forest is burned for burning’s sake. The Brazilian is just about to give up on his lifelong bigtime revenge when the giant throws him into a well and tells him to wake the frig up, and with some hurry. They need to find the Pirate that beat them, in order to beat the world. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Cool,” says the Brazilian. “Now that I’m soaked, I can hear the words from your mouth place. Why you wanna find the pirate. To kill him?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“I thought he could help, I think he is top shelf.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Oh, I see. Sounds pretty...neat.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Yeah and he can’t be beat!” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“You are right, Fezzy, I think the pirate is the secret. But where do we find him?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I heard he was captured by a pink ogre.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This parts pretty confused. But, breaks down like this, the pirate is being tortured by Toes, whose real name is Tyrone (and also has one hundred friggin’ toes), a pink ogre, and the frigging humping prince. They mostly kill the pirate, who appears mostly dead. So Toes and Prince high five and get back to the castle to do dumb stuff. The Brazilian and the Tall man pretty easily find the pink ogre’s underground treefort, and are super bummed to see the pirate is dead. Then the Brazilian has this idea to use a magician to make the pirate dressed in black back to life. So the tall man and the Brazilian kill the pink ogre while Toes and Humps are out playing war at the castle, they throw the pirate in an ice cream cart and they go to Magic Mike’s house. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Magic Mike is an old wizard with long fingers and a sloppy thirst for mudslings. He’s slurping a sling out of a crazy straw when they knock. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We need your magic,” says the Brazilian.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’m retired,” says the Magician.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s for revenge!” says the Brazilian. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I don’t do revenge no more,” says the Magician.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It is for love!” says the tall man.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Love is overrated,” says the Magician</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You’re overrated!” yells a woman from inside the Magic House. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oy, my wife! Shut it lady!” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“True love is real!” shouts his wife. I get a vomit taste in my mouth. I almost tell Gramps to beat it. He makes a fist at me and mouths, shut it, twerp. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s also to blave,” says the Brazilian.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“To Blave!” shouts the magician. “That is worth all the whiles!” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What’s Blave?” asks the tall man. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It means Bluff in Magic, bring him in, let’s take a look!” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The magician lays the dead man out on his magic table. He asks his wife for a saw. His houseguests look puzzled. “I kid!” he shouts. “Maybe we’ll make this quick.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes. Please. We must bluff soon, and we need pirates for this.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Of course.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">First the Magician gives the dead Pirate Reynolds a chocolate wrapped reviving candy. The henchmen look at the magic man, like, <em>the frig is that thing? </em>Magic man answers without hesitation, “It’s a jumpstart to the heart. But I wrap it in a nice sweet chocolate shell so it’s real pleasant like. Once the living kicks in, you know, life can leave a mean after taste, knowudImsayin?” Magic Mike places his hands on both their shoulders. “You do, you both do.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Magician grabs a big fireplace accordion places it over the dead pirate’s mouth and blows into the dead Pirate Reynold’s lungs, The fellas are in disbelief, and think this guy maybe is not so good at magic after all. The Magic Man whips out another chocolate wrapped life ball from his cloak pocket and says, “give him another in a little less than half an hour, then he should be mostly living again.” </p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong><em>Last Part</em></strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	The Brazilian and the Big Man wave their goodbyes to Magic Mike and the wife after throwing the limp pirate into his ice cream cart home. They say have fun storming the castle and the trio is off. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	They reach the castle walls, give the Pirate his second chocolate, and he startles awake. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“I’ll kill you both. I’ll use my fists. I can’t feel my fists. Where are we?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“You moved your mouth!” says the tall man. “That’s wonderful.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“We are at the castle gate,” shouts the Brazilian like the Pirate can’t hear him. “I am going to avenge my father. The one hundred toed man is behind the gate. Oh, we are going to save your princess if we have time and stop the marriage from the humping prince.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	The pirate says, “I cannot move my body. I am no help to you.” He scratches his brow. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Hey!” says the tall man, “you just moved your arm. That’s great!” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“What are our assets?” asks the Pirate. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“My daggers, his hands, your brain place.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“And nothing else?” says the Pirate. “There are thirty men behind the wall.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“I have a fireproof cloak and your ice cream cart.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Why didn’t you say so,” says the Pirate.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“We just saved your life, please stop acting so impatient,” says the Brazilian. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“My apologies,” says the Pirate. “I’ve been a pirate a very long time.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	The tall man sets his cloak on fire and they convince the turkeys guarding the castle that they should be let in. They all scare from fire super easily and disperse. Once behind the castle gates they split up, the tall man and the Brazilian go searching for danger. The Pirate looks for his love. He finds a bed and lays down on it. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	The Brazilian finds the man with one hundred toes. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Excuse me,” he says. “Do you happen to have one hundred toes on your feet.” The man looks at his weird boots and up at the Brazilian, turns, and runs. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“Hey, I am Indigo Mantiega, you killed my father, prepare to die!” He chases after him through the whole castle. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	The pirate watches his love enter the room, staying quiet like a creeper on her bed. She places a dagger over her heart, looking like she’s about to do the deed herself, rather than marry dumbface. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">	“There’s like three perfect breasts in the world,” says the pirate.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh my sweet Wembley,” she says stroking the pirates face and kissing his mostly dead lips. “Why aren’t you kissing me?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’m mostly dead.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What the hell does -” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Ah-ha!” Prince Humpsandbumps stands at the door. “I’ve found you. And now you will die.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Brazilian has caught up to the hundred toed man. He again says Hi to him, tells him his name, and prepares him for death. The hundred toed man, like a real sneak, daggers the Brazilian in the ribs. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“All of these years,” says Mantiega. “All of these years to find you and now die.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You’re that brat whose dad I killed to take some daggers, you’ve been chasing me the whole time?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I may have some strength left.” The Brazilian lifts his sword and smacks two slices off the killer’s face. “Hello!” he shouts. Again he repeats his name and his last known address this time, and then prepares him to die. “HELLO!” he shouts! </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Why do you keep saying that?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I am Indigo Mantiega! You killed my father, prepare to die! Offer me money.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Anything.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Offer me fame and women. Offer me twin sugar plantations and a magnificent boat.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The world.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Give me my father back you gruesome sammamabitch!” Indigo the dagger throwing Brazilian slices old hundred toes right through the heart socket. He spits up some blood and dies a big time death which is super sweet. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The prince stands ready to fight the pirate in the bedroom. The pirate just fakes it like he can use his body and says, “Drop your sword.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Or what,” says the prince. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Or I cut you up in bits.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You’re bluffing,” says the prince. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Then how is it I can stand.” The pirate stands, suddenly able to use a part of his body he didn’t know was undead again. Then he leans on a bed post. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Shall we fight to the death?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No,” says the pirate. “I’m going to cut off your lips and your eyes and your arms and your legs.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes, and then my ears, I suppose.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“NO!” says the pirate. “I’ll leave your ears perfect so you can hear every scream of everybody ever that looks at you.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My grandpa says the Pirate chops the prince into bits and they all ride off in the sunset. I’m like, that’s friggin’ sweet, and grandpa says no junk, you turkey. Then they kiss, says Gramps. I’m like oh boy, see you tomorrow you frriggin’ mothball! Freeze Frame! </p>

      <title>A Morning Worm</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2018/11/7/a-morning-worm</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Did you hear that? I thought it was a thump. It sounded like a boom.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">No one’s listening. When beaks dart at the soil we can feel the pressure. Hear the thoomps. I woke on the floor. I thought the thoomps were in my head. I lost the room with the clock. I don’t have a gauge on what day part it is. The others are on barscrews sucking straws. I’ve had enough rot for three mes. I’m not ready to push through dirt, squeeze and contract. I don’t think I should crawl at all. Thoomp. They hear it too. They’re looking up from their screws. A claw scratches the grass away, up on the surface, the sound feels like a knife peeling away an eyelid. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Worms!</em> I shout. <em>Wiggle! </em>They laugh. Schrom falls off his barscrew. Flortch vomits pink, tries to keep some in. Vyrm is near the phonical, about to turn the disco up again. <em>She’ll peck right to us, </em>I scream<em>.</em> They suck their straws.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I roll my body to begin the waves, my bottom most muscles squeeze first and that begins the ripple. I squeeze my midsection, release, repeat. Then I am a bent thing, my middle off the ground, still facing up. I keep the momentum of the wave, hold it up with every part of me. My head throbs from the rot in my body. I should vomit. The ripple reaches the muscles near my face. I slide further towards the bar exit. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Something wet on the back of my head. I contract and squeeze to start another wave. I twist my head down, my mouth meets a puddle. I touch my tongue to it. <em>Rot</em>. I take a gulp, a second one, my body quivers. I suck all of it out of the puddle as my muscles bring the wave to the middle and my body is bent off the ground again. I wiggle my way to the exit. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The disco is blaring now, the thoomps are getting closer. This one is relentless. She’ll storm the room. I say goodbye to these barscrews, to this room. Goodbye, worms. The daylight breaks through the room and their purple and blue bodies all look nude and plain in the sun. The beak tip is bright, as it pierces through the soil crumbles. This is morning. This is every morning. </p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Charlie does the cash check-out job in the local frozen food market. He wears a beige apron and lives a beige life. He activates the belt, floats the bar codes over the tabletop scanner. He likes to play a game of counting in his head, adding what the total will be, listening carefully so that every item is accompanied with its own individual beep, while keeping his eyes off the screen. He prefers when customers pay in cash because cash cannot go wrong. He works up a serious sweat when there is a line and the card machine gives him grief.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He hoped to be the meat slicer before he was hired. They told him he didn’t have the experience. He kept his mouth closed behind the resume held up between him and Mrs. Needlebaker. He wasn’t sure if she was reading the words or just holding the thing up. Would she find at the bottom the bit about chainsaws, his natural tendency towards cutting and slicing?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Charlie makes wooden elves with his saw. He tops off the instrument full of fuel, then he runs it until empty. A tank a session, as many elves as he can make. His elves are jagged things, definitely not gnomes, and nothing like the cookie making elves they sell in the store. His elves have knobs for tails, their clothing is the woodgrain that runs up their bodies. They are not smiling, dancing creatures, they are introspective, sometimes even worried looking.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When she handed back the paper and said, “cashier will suit you,” he knew she had not taken into consideration his saw work. Perhaps he did not explain it well on paper. He studied the resume as he walked out of the store that day and realized he had not explained it at all. Under other, he simply wrote, Little Wooden Elf series: continuous. He didn’t explain his technique at all. How would she have known he was so well prepared for the meat slicer? How would she know that after the saw there was much work to be done?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Once the jagged little blocks are carved he whittles them down to more refined shapes. Some have pear bodies, with wide bellies, some are thin and stretched tall. When an elf is complete he walks deep into the woods and hides it where he feels may be a natural setting for it to live, if they were to live. He will search for the cave like knot of a large tree, or the underside of a wide fallen branch. His elves look beautiful standing in rich, dark soil. Once they are in position he takes their photograph, then he leaves them out in the wilderness, hoping they’ll befriend a fox or hedgehog.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Today marks Charlie’s eleventeenth week as a cashier. He has looked at himself in the mirror every morning for six days, saying aloud, <em>you will ask to become a slicer or you will hand in your apron.</em> Charlie arrives at work, through the side door near the loading dock. Tubbs is there, and Maryanne, both penciling in squares on the calendar. Charlie’s apron is hanging by the other aprons, a row of beige fabric on a cream-colored wall. On the opposite wall are the red aprons, the aprons the butchers wear. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Charlie nods at the row of red aprons, balls his hands into fists and walks to the office of Mrs. Needlebaker. She is on the phone when he approaches the glass. She holds up one long finger, to signal him to wait. He is going to lose momentum. He is worried that just this pause will ruin the whole ordeal. He notices a man in the chair opposite Mrs. Needlebaker as she hangs up the phone. She says something and extends her hand to the man wearing a khaki jacket over khaki pants. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The door swings open and out steps this man, followed by Mrs. Needlebaker. “Oh Charlie,” she says, “meet our new butcher, Samuel.” Charle is bewildered. Who is this Samuel? He does not understand it. Charlie crumples the paper in his hand, with the words he’d been reciting all week printed over it. He pounces on Samuel, screaming, about how he was meant to slice the meat. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mrs. Needlebaker shrieks. Charlie topples over the khaki clad new hire, both falling onto a row of plastic chairs that explode out from under them, scattering across the hallway. Samuel, overcome by the young man’s strength, flails beneath his weight for help, then he socks Charlie right in the nose, blood spattering over Samuel and his khaki jacket. Two cleaners in white aprons pull Charlie off the poor fellow. Charlie yells, “I am a wood carver, I am a cutter!” </p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong>~</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is nearly sunset when he arrives home after the confrontation. The golden light of the warm afternoon sun beams through his bedroom window. He rests his jacket on a knob behind the door, and throws away the paperwork he was given upon his exit. He thinks maybe he will carve through the night when he notices a strange pattern across his floor. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">His bonsai tree is cast in the yellow light. Dust particles twinkle as they float, weightless. Charlie follows the trail of tiny markings along the way to his front door. They continue over the slate rocks on the path that leads to the forest. He crouches low to the floor to inspect the marks. They are foot prints. His little wooden elf is gone.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When he began making wooden elves, many years ago, before he was even sure what to call the things, he’d cut a log into a chunky shape. From the shape he carved out his first creature. It had the hair and the body parts of a man, but it was miniature in size, with a knob for a tail, and an expressive little face. He thought of this creature as a friend. He whittled it often back then, refining its shape, until it was clear that it was an elf.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Though he considered the work finished he often took the creature down to rub or polish an area of its body. He kept this elf high on a shelf in his bedroom, where it could watch over his space with a clean view of his bonsai tree. The miniature tree was given to him many elves after the first by a woman in a marketplace selling sculpting tools. She had inquired after the type of work Charlie would do with the items he was purchasing. He told her he made creatures that he placed in the forest. “Spirits,” Charlie remembers the woman saying. “You make spirits to look after the trees. Trees are spirits too.” She traced her fingers over the pattern of the small tree’s branches. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Charlie thinks a great deal about the footprints that lead out of his home. He takes a photograph before the sun sets to capture the pattern over the concrete squares of his floor. He looks at the empty space under the light that even this morning shined on his little wooden elf. Then Charlie remembers something else the woman who gave him the tree said. She looked out over the market, and pointed out towards the trees, and spoke. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You will tend to them, and they will tend to you. But, like all spirits do, when the road curves, they will leave you. And you too, will leave them. This is not an abandonment. This is acceptance, a spirit’s way of acknowledging one’s capacity for growth. Alone, you must focus, you must listen to your own breath. Then you will know it is time to move on.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong><em>What’s Left.</em></strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Gorey held a funeral party for Gorey, he’d decided to end it. He called his trusted colleagues Herbert and Kirk to his lonesome tower on the big horizon. It was just his apartment, on the top floor of the lone building in the long valley that survived the stupid flood. Gorey designed the tower himself. When he tried to get people to live in it, they laughed at him, saying why would we live so high, and pull our bodies and local produce up the floors by your ridiculous pully-system? They kicked and spit and laughed at him. They taunted him by feminizing his first name from Eddie to Edie. He was not offended by their ignorant response, but he did not like the pointing fingers of the townspeople. When the flood came most of them were wiped away, reaching up towards his building, not remembering what to call him, yelling, <em>Edie, Edie, Edie</em> until they were just a small part of the big sea. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When Herbert moved here he installed microphones into every known crevice of his split level ranch, out in the wide plains. He soundproofed the walls so full of foam that when the big stupid flood washed away his new town his house popped off its foundation into a boat, his unwittingly airtight vessel. Before the flood he spent all of his days digging through video and audio samples of his daily routines, cutting them into tiny pieces, and feeding them to a synth modulator to make music from. There is an entire ten-track album of him chewing, entitled <em>Mouth Suite</em>. His house was both instrument and dungeon. His private place and a place too private for him to withstand. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The great sonic reinforcement saved Herbert’s life’s work, but now untethered from land, he was without electricity, so he dipped deeply into the private stock of rums, waiting for an electrician to show up. When his houseboat crashed into the lone tower, he saw that bearded wizard prowling around. Then the wizard, <em>Gorey</em>, saw him. Each man raised their hand at the other, staring blankly, then the old man in the tower nodded, and waved Herbert in. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As of late Herbert had befriended a cricket who couldn’t stop whispering in his ear. It was distracting his work prior to the flood, and became his only solace afterward. They’re conversations went on for hours, often only about the particular wobbling sound the cricket could make with a single leg. As Gorey waved him in he pointed to his shoulder and mouthed, <em>and the cricket too?</em> The old man inside the tower shrugged this off as if to say, <em>why the blorg not. </em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Roland Kirk Junior had long been stuck in the body of a sixteen year old. He played a classic body switch game years before, and won or lost depending on the day one asked him. The teen that he switched with lost Kirk’s body on a camping trip to a forest monster. So Kirk remained in the body of young Steggle Thorman. He rebelled against Steggle’s fresh-faced outer appearance and unsoiled organs by smoking lavender dipped cigars in a near constant state of delirious drunkenness. He moved out of Steggle’s house, in a violent screaming match with Mr. and Mrs. Thorman that tracked surprisingly well as a teenage rebellion. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Kirk moved into Space Mountain, back to his glass house, a marvel that stuck out of the jagged rock, which contained his ghost laboratory and his spaceship. Before the flood came he left the planet for a disco in the Nebular system. He lost his whole crew in a dance bet, and returned to his hometown to find it waterlogged, soggy, lifeless. Even his body’s biological creators, the Thormans were gone. After he cleared his way through some debris he saw the silhouettes of his two future besties up high in the lonesome tower on the big horizon. He didn’t ring the bell to let them know he was out there. He flew back to his glass house, then put on a light show. When the top floor of the tall building across the valley started blinking its lights on and off, he knew they knew. </p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">On the long table in his giant dining room the trio studied the map for their campaign. It had gone on like this the past year. Herbert held a microphone and tried to capture various guzzles as he slugged his own bottle. Kirk slurped wine coolers at the table’s head, drawing characters and naming his friend’s future destroyers. Gorey had tilted back a bottle of poison in front of his friends before, but cracking a second bottle made even Herbert stop paying attention to his own body for a moment.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You serious abouts this funeral party, Gore? asks Herbert.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Serious as an underwater snail, chaps, says Gorey.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Well I think you’ve got it all wrong, says Herbert.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tell you what, says the old man in the child’s body, let’s make it a contest.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Make what a contest? asks Herbert.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The campaign, says the man child. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What are your stakes? asks Gorey.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Oh, only everything, says Kirk Junior. If I survive, we fly off planet for good.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And what if he concludes our story, Gorey nods to Herbert. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If I wrap it up, says Herbert, we turn this tower into a boat. The professors looked at Gorey, who was spinning a wooden nickel over a drawing of a large roach eating a bag of crisps. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Oh, do you need a response? Ha, if I survive this riddle... we die, says Gorey. We, drink ourselves under. Here. Now. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What the men found, after the flood, spiraling around their planet in Kirk Junior’s space machine was an endless ocean beyond the valley where Gorey’s tower stood. The men believed they were all that was left of life here. Though they did not cover every inch of the planet, what was left was almost entirely water and after flying a great distance, they decided to turn back before losing the direction for the one home they knew. It was only a matter of time before Gorey longed for something else, and now he was ready to move onto another dimensional plane altogether. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Very well, says the old man with the death wish, let’s begin. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong><em>The Campaign</em></strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is a dark mountain, says Kirk Junior.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Is there a flood? asks Gorey. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Listen, you know where we left off, says Kirk. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You were an Orbling, weren’t you Kirk, says Herbert, or some such creature of the night. He plucks a string of floss looped around a tooth recording into a handheld device. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Yes, says Kirk, I am known to live off the blood of the living, whilst caring for my worms. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The worms that mine the blood? asks Gorey</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Yes, those are the worms, says Kirk, my pretties mine the blood of the living, and I eat the worms once they’re full like leeches. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But they’re not leeches? Asks Herbert.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Yes, to be clear, they’re not leeches, says Kirk. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Because they’re worms, says Gorey.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Do you fellows want to begin this campaign, or not? demands Kirk Junior. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Well, says Herbert, I imagine we’ll have to at some point. Or the game itself might be our end. He motions to Gorey, slurping another guzzle of poison back, spilling a cup’s worth into his beard. He rings out the hair over the bottle to salvage what spilled. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We begin on a dark mountain, says Kirk Junior. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Anything like the mountain where you park that ridiculous ship? asks Gorey. The teenage face of professor Kirk beats red, a kettle set to boil. A tantrum brews beneath his many freckles. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Alright, alright, walk us through - </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Dark mountain, says Kirk Junior. The Habbleknots are knocking on our doorstep. We’ve held ourselves up in the mines of Curbleslorm. A demony demon known as the Cham-cham has dug a powerful series of tunnels where it hibernates for decades on end. These are the tunnels we’ll need to navigate to escape the Habbleknots when they break down our door.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The mountain has a door? Asks Gorey. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Enough, says Herbert. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s a big door. It was manufactured in the days of firebreathers and the long-nightfishers, when the dogs bit back, and the women had six hands and birthed double babies with deep green skin. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I remember those ones, says Herbert. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Oh, me too, says Gorey, toasting to the air.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We have to go deep into the cave, says Kirk.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I nominate you, Roland, says Herbert, to lead our expedition. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My <em>name</em>. Is Emerald, Capricornious Mufflington, shouts Kirk. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Listen, Muffington. We’re nominating you, says Herbert, laughing and patting the pubescent shoulder of his old friend. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What the devil is that, says Gorey, suddenly clear-eyed, as if the buzzard had swallowed a marble. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What’s what? Says Herbert. A shadow dashes across their faces between them and the sun. In the hot heat of this old valley Gorey’s windows are open to every element unless it is raining sideways (the acid stains his leather, and he’d rather not put up with it). A winged thing, says the old buzzard. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What thing? Asks Herbert. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Out the window, old boy, says Gorey. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What are you on about? Asks Kirk. Then, a second flash of shadow between them and their sun. This time all three see it: A bird flying across the day sky. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Where’d that devil come from, says Gorey. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s impossible, says Kirk. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What’ll we do? Asks Herbert. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The bearded professor, Eddie Gorey puts down his poison, slamming it against the glass top of his decadent dining table. Your ship ready, old man, he asks Kirk. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Is the campaign over? asks the body switcher. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You’ve won, mate, says Gorey. Maybe we all just did.</p>

      <title>The Purglepine Makes a Wish</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2018/12/25/the-purglepine-makes-a-wish</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Did you know,” the Purglepine asks Dog, “I became friends with the moon?” The two prickle-covered creatures lay with their backs against the snow, late one night, watching the flakes fall down towards them. Purgle holds his arm up against the sky to inspect his missing prickles, spreads his hand out to block the falling snow from getting in his eyes. “The moon and I, we talk to one another out here.” Dog scratches the back of her head against a wet pile of leaves beneath a layer of white flakes. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I only see,“ replies Dog, “that you stay up deep into the night, without making sounds with your mouth. I cannot hear the moon’s responses either, but I enjoy watching your eyebrows rise and the smirks that spread across your face. But, mostly, when you are restless, I sleep.” The two old friends watch their breath make blue clouds in the moonglow.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’ve been wondering if I should ask the moon how to talk to the stars. I want to question the stars about fireworks.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Why don’t you ask the fireworks?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I feel like if I wanted to know a house, I would start with the Forest, right?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Very well,” says Dog, “ask the stars. I’m sure they’ll have something to say.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I can’t ask them outright, you know,” says Purgle. “I have to talk to them in my mind.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes, yes. I remember. How about this? I will go to sleep, over by that broken tree limb. Wake me when you have an answer.” Dog curls herself into a ball under the fallen branch. The Purglepine walks a long time in the light of the moon, the stars filling in the gaps between the branches of the trees overhead. Purgle walks until he is nearly out of forest before he begins. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Stars</em>, the Purglepine thinks. <em>What can you tell me about fireworks?</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Nothing,” boom the stars in unison, a group of hundreds of voices that sound like one perfect voice, startling Purgle to a stiff-spined freeze. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Allow me to explain,</em> offers the Purglepine easing his body back to a pace, <em>I am quite fond of fireworks, as I am so very fond of stars. Due to this I am deeply curious how the humans were able to make explosions of organized light. It is as if they followed your own blueprint.</em> </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Our designs were never so bold. We were built for containment.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Your shapes are the very essence of light.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well said, Purgle.” The stars exhale, which is a breeze that trickles against what remains of Purglepine’s prickles, the air feels crisp against his skin. “Down in the village,” the stars say in their booming chorus, “they have strung lights around a tree. Those lights will have your answer.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">From deep within the wandering woods the Purglepine makes his way down into the village. The decorative lights of the houses look as if the stars themselves were mirrored across the village in the empty lake of the valley. Purgle arrives in the town square, drawn to the center of the park, where a single tree stands covered in twinkling lights. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Purglepine sweeps snow with his hoof, exposing the frozen grass beneath the white, not knowing where to begin his questioning, wondering, <em>where do I start to ask about fireworks?</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The light is the gift.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It is our gift and yours.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“To have a voice inside the dark.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Even though we love the dark.” These lights talk as quickly as they twinkle. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We’re very enthusiastic about the dark.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It is where we do most of our dancing.” It is a staggering array of voices. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s just so important to have a difference.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“A difference of opinions.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“A guide to get you along your way.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>Please Slow down</em>, Purgle thinks. The lights just as suddenly respond, slowing their voices to a crawl. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“For those that cannot see the guide is often a voice.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“For those who cannot speak the guide is often a hand.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And for those that cannot hear the guide is often a light. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That is our way.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Purglepine is overcome with gratitude for each voice of the chorus. He wants, in this moment, to bottle each, to contain them. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We are for everyone, every projection of light. That is the secret of the firework.” The Purglepine turns and darts away from the large tree. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Wait, where are you running?” yell the lights.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>I have to run and tell Dog. </em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What will you tell him.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>I think I’ve got it! A most wonderful thing.</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What is so wonderful?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><em>You have granted my wish. I have to tell her! Thank you, lights! </em></p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Dog,” the Purglepine heaves, out of breath, scratching an empty patch of missing prickles. “I spoke to the moon, the stars, and the lights.” Dog lifts a lazy eyelid, half-awake. His excited partner crouches near to her.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And what,” Dog says, rolling onto her back, eyeing her tummy for a rub, “did they all have to say?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They said,” the large prickly beast places his hand against Dog’s stomach to rub, “well, no, they didn’t really even have to say it.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Have you forgotten already? Do you need to go back?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh Dog, <em>no</em>!” The Purglepine stands now, above Dog, above the large fallen branch that shelters her, as a fog blankets the stars from above like a lampshade, defusing and yet spreading their light. “How I understand it, the lights are there as our signal, and the paths they leave in our sky is the memory, which is also a trail in our minds.” Dog raises her eyebrow. “This is their great gift, my dear: a great and terrific light, and a trail that leads to the light that once was, and the memory that remains of that history living inside each of us.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We are lucky to have this time with each other under such light,” says Dog. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We are lucky,” says, the Purglepine, “in light, of all things.”</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Day one it grew a tail, but they couldn’t say for sure that’s what it was. The cylindrical appendage sprouted and wagged. Day two it spun in circles, the tail brushed against the light floor pivoting the bright pink body around. Day three it woke with a foot out, split in the middle by two shades of green. The second foot sprouted that afternoon in what appeared to be an exhausting push from the body. Day four they thought something was wrong, the two feet and tail did not move at all. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Day five they poured a thimble of water into the light cube, rinsing the creature’s body. Two front legs extended from the body with a <em>fwump</em>. The four legs restlessly kicked against the floor, bending in the middle, searching for ground. Once standing on all fours the creature inched forward, scraping its toes against the light floor. Its legs buckled underneath the weight of its round body. It extended only its hind legs from the floor, pushed its front feet and blank top around the cube, like a push broom. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Day six it woke and sprang up on all fours. It galloped to a sprint and smashed against the side wall. A bump grew at the point of impact, and then three spikes. By midday its head was fully exposed, eyes closed. Its legs waddled beneath its body walking in circles along the edges of the cube. The creature opened its eyes. The bright white light below and above and all around it was a great contrast to living in the dark, yet there were no guides or clues to the surrounding area, everything was light,until it looked down and saw its legs moving. It spent the rest of the day lifting a leg and investigating the bottom of a foot. Then the next. Then a hind leg, and the other, marveling at its two shades of green and bright fuschia belly. It stayed sitting upright or laying on its back and kicking the air for two full days. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Day eight it was lifeless again. They poured four thimbles over the creature. It erupted from sleep and seemed to plant its legs into the cube itself as its body began to tremble. It made the noise of a bell tone and the light cube cracked and shattered all around it. Then it grew to the size of a small horse.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The world exploded in front of the creature. Walls. Cabinets. Men in white coats. It noticed a long light above them that it mistook for its parents. It screamed a serene series of melodies. Though it was distressed its noises were relaxing. It tried to jump for the fluorescent lights. It kicked and rang notes. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The creature looked down at its own legs and there beneath them was a dark pool. When it lifted a leg, the pool moved. It tried to step outside the pool. It could not step outside the pool. The pool followed the creature. It pounced across the room. The pool was always attached. It sprang out of the room down a long corridor lined with relatives of its cube hanging above. At the end of the hall a bright white light shined. The pool was racing beneath it. It pounced through the open door and was again bathed in familiar light on all sides. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The pool was gone. The floor was aglow. It lifted its legs one after the next and only saw light beneath them. When the creature finally looked up, standing beside it a thing with similar legs and a body with the same color as its own. The two creatures looked at one another and blinked. Then they made music out of laughter.<br></p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If I wore a labcoat I would call myself Nelson. I’d take exams and empty beakers into basins. I would work under neon lights after dusk settled into night. After the skeleton crew exited the laboratories and daydreamers parked and smashed their timecards into the slot machines I’d run to the parking lot and slash their tires. In shaving cream I would write, Daylight is not your savior.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If I slept in through the blue skies I would take an early morning shower and crawl into my clean sheets naked and aching. I would have a gin fridge and a bedside ice bucket. I would be a ghost. I would record songs on a borrowed guitar laying against the mattress in my sunless room. My name would be Anton. I would leave the door unlocked. My lost lovers would creep into my present tense.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If I tore out the pages from my books and left the machines within my house without batteries I would force myself to write things down. I would take my wallet to the gas station and buy blue pens and a spiral notebook. I would look the man in the eye and shake his oily hands until he squeezed back harder than me. I would be Kurt. I would grip doorknobs tight when I twisted them. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If I were to break my hands I would warm them in soft baths of aloe vera. I would hang a portrait of a pool above my stolen hospital bed. I would be looking down into the water’s depths from below. I would take my touchtone phone off my nightstand. I would dial until she picked up, someone like me, waiting in the dark. I will call her Josephine. </p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This one is my Lakers. It buttons like a regular. But it’s got splits sides. This is why it is my love. My Frankenstein. There’s a twin. The twin is a reversal. I took ‘em both to a lady, she ripped ‘em at the seams and made ‘em how you see ‘em. Pretty soon after one I made ‘em all like this, split from the middle and the sleeves. I have a green and grey, and a blue and white. I even figured a black and red, those are my Bulls. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You can be two yous in a split top. I stand at the mirror with my left shoulder facing and I’m a purple, and I flip sides and am a yellow. What’s a purple feeling? What’s a yellow? I think grapes and french fries. I think wines and beers. I picture a whole world in divides. Maybe I could walk a straight line down the middle of it. I could play both sides.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I scored baskets a long time. I shoot good, both hands. I take a long dribble and a mean hook. I got so many free throws. When I sleep I choose a single color sheet set and remove all my sides. I don’t want to wake confused, or sleep confused. I want to wake up and know the day because the colors I pick for it. I paint plants on the wall to change the balance when I take long looks in the mirror. Sometimes I even have to lift my hand to pick which way to be. I give myself the signal.</p>

      <title>Tom is Dead</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2019/2/20/tom-is-dead</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tom dies. It isn’t like what he thought it would be. He thought he’d embrace the dead or walk out of his body and into the world he knew, unseen. Instead there is only darkness. For what feels like eternity he lays flat in a shape he cannot articulate. Eventually there is the sensation of touch and the tremble of movement as Tom’s shape is lifted from the darkness. The warmth of light hits Tom everywhere. The shape cuts the air as it is lifted higher and higher. The feeling of light and air against Tom’s shape trickle throughout his being. Then it is dark again and the shape is pulled away from itself, halved against sharp dense objects, halved once more and another time, battered and smashed and lapped by a wet and moving thing. It is warm inside the dark. Tom is everywhere, feels a dizzying sensation of being countless pieces in a mouth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tom does not know (because he cannot see) that he has become a pretzel. The thin sticks Tom was eating that he himself choked on, ending his human life, were the last things he touched. That is what he became. As he is chewed it feels like ecstasy, each part of him glistening wet and breaking into an even lesser version of itself, dissolving. This feeling lasts for what feels like years, being tossed around and fondled and then swallowed. Inside the throat Tom’s many pieces rejoin as mush, breakdown into energy sources and fats, he is pulled away from himself. The embrace of the tubes that Tom travels through is warm and complete. This will be the best part of Tom’s life as a pretzel before his parts are heated into waste. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tom dies again. He only remembers being a million pieces in the body of Greg. Greg was a good body to be in. Warm, safe. He does not remember his human form. He was not known among the body as Tom. He was particle, sustenance, waste. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tom is solid waste. He lives within pipes and sewers. When he is eventually still, and out of the swirling rush of liquid movement, he is smashed against other solid waste. He spreads into and up against soft forms and liquids. He is porous and everywhere. When the fire ignites the waste pit the heat burns every piece of Tom, he becomes a million fibers against the fire. All goes dark.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tom is born into the light. He is gathered along with the soil and other nutrients that he has become one with and sprinkled across a wide open horizon. There is sunlight, which feels familiar, and the plastic bag that he awoke in, and the treads on the skin of the human hands that separate and spread him across the soil. Tom settles in against the dirt floor, feels water trickle against him and all the other particles. He can feel the energy of him submerging, of a seed rubbing against him, until he is able to cradle the seed, accept it, nurture it. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A piece of Tom melds with each seed. In each seed is another lifetime. Throughout each stage of moving up and stretching out away from the soil Tom becomes more of the plants in the garden. He feels the touch of those human hands against his leaves, flowers, and fruits. Each ridge along the lines of the thumb vibrate against the pedals. To be held, grasped, caressed between two objects tenderly, it all feels so familiar.</p>

      <title>An Axe for Peaches: PART II</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2019/2/14/an-axe-for-peaches-ii</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <h2 style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://letsworm.com/writes-draws/2018/5/16/an-axe-for-peaches">(go to part I)</a></h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">227 watches 103’s hands as he husks the corn. He snaps the shank from the base of each ear, strips the silks off the fruit. He discards the silks and shanks from the ears, emptying the first basket, filling two others. They stand together, his coveralls tight around his midsection. 103 wears a loose tattered garment draped over his shoulders like a shawl. He daily complains of the chill of the camp. It is always damp, frequently wet, covered in constant grey. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">227 lays husks and silks to stoke the fire, as 103 lays the cobs atop the chain link grate. She is transfixed by his square knuckles, the way they wrap around the cobs. He places one ear after the other in a row above the flames. He will remove them this way, as he did yesterday, as he’s done for the weeks she has been here, with his large bare hands, making the corn miniature when wrapped inside those massive palms, unconcerned with their considerable heat. Stray blonde locks hang over his face, escaping the high bun he fashions atop his head. His shoulders, like his knuckles, are wide and square with wiry curls of hair that run down his arms. He is a block of a man, his presence the foundation of any room.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">227 prepares the beans in a wide pot near 103, talking out of the side of her mouth in a whisper.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Smart, about the corn.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What’s smart?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Our keepers. The corn has moisture too. You know this? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Keeps us thirsty.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well, it was my idea, the corn. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah, easy on digestion, more liquid. Our bodies need this. I was half joking when I said it, but it stuck. Thought they’d turn me down. But its light on cost, and keeps the canned peach budget down.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They set up the corn in a pyramid on the long table. Each number will take a single cob and a measured half cup of beans. 103 handles the corns. 227 scoops a cup and slices the excess beans with a wood dowel, dumps it atop each plate. They do not talk during service. The men come quickly, hoping for an extra bean to slip through past the dowel, for an extra ear to end up atop their plate. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Otherwise he is talking, always. It is his talking that fills the days and shortens them. 103 has stories of this new world as if it is an old one. He speaks of the events of the last year or two here, like ancient histories. Standing over the corn, for the second time in her life all she can think about is the taste of meat, of snapping a chicken by its neck, of stripping and cleaning it hastily to get it over a fire.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She went vegetarian a few weeks in her teens. Her parents developed their eye roll, didn’t lift a hand to help, or an ear to understand. She ate fruits, vegetables, but mostly didn’t eat. Three salads a day with no dressings. When her parents came back from a short weekend away, they didn’t find solo cups or the remnants of a party, they found their daughter doubled-over with cramps, her body starved for protein. She was back on meat within a month.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong>~</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This is the third straight day of heavy rain this week. Hard to keep the fire going like this, in the wet - the mist has taken up residence. Her hut door is stuck. Mud is clogging up the entryway, sliding under the jam and hardening beneath it. 227 is restless with all the rain, afraid of being trapped in the hut. She opens the door, aware that it will be interpreted as an invitation to the ghosts.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The other men here are shadows, they rise and spread like vapor. During daylight hours, they are visible, in their pale grey skin, raisined by the moisture and the rainfall. But past curfew they are snakes, slithering up, appearing out of nowhere. Her locked door is the only reason she sleeps at all.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It comes as no surprise to 227, leaving her door ajar enough to get in and out of, that such a serpent would appear. He even looked like a hiss. Beady eyes, mouth open while breathing, hair wet over his face. He is a shape, then a face, then a foot in the door. She reaches for her axe when a familiar hand descends on the intruder’s head. The intruder’s body goes limp under the clonk of the fist. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I could see ‘im round the way, lurking near your window,” says 103, ducking his head into the hut. 227 lights her candle. 103 cradles his balled fist in his open palm. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Did you hurt your hand?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’m fine. Why didn’t you tell me about the door? I would’ve closed it.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I wouldn’t have had a way out.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I would’ve let you out in the morning.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I can’t live kept that way. They could just as easily burn me in place if they saw you lock me in.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Who?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Any snake in this village.” She motions to the limp body on the ground. “Come in here, 103, get out of that rain. Is it hurt? Let me see.” 103 bends to check on the body, places his square hand around its soft neck. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What is it?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Think he’s dead.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">227 jumps out of bed. She sticks her head out of the hut, peers out at the black village. A lit torch hobbles in the distance, a guard on his rounds. Help me close the door.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“He’ll stink by morning,” says 103 says.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Forget about him.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I never killed a man.” 227 places her hand over 103’s, gathers his attention with her eyes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What is beyond the wall?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Don’t know.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Search your mind. Deliveries you’ve made, the farmland perimeters, what have you seen? How far past to an open gate?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’ve seen them farms. But beyond them farms is only forest. And word is they’ve hidden traps, electronics, like walking into an open throat.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Sounds like a proper place to get lost.” 103 shakes his head at her, fearful of the idea awakening in the hut. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“There ain’t no good way out.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“This body laying here, we can distract the camp with its death.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They’ll hunt us.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They’ve given us axes.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They got more axes. Swords. Arrows. Guns, I think.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Have you seen guns?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No. But they’re there. Why wouldn’t they have ‘em?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“If you can get me to the forest -”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">103 looks around 227’s hut. There is no trace that she occupies the place, no small carvings line the windows, no extra linens are folded on the mud-shelves, no additional coveralls. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You were going to leave anyway.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Tonight, yes.” 227 reaches beneath her pillow, she extends two full ears of corn. “Here,” she says, handing 103 a full ear, “we’ll need our energy.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Who are you?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Just get me to the forest. Now, help me lift him.” </p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong>~</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Near the food hall is an abandoned pole. They carry the body low between them by its arms and feet. A snapped twig could rat them out. The moon hangs behind dense clouds promising more rain. 103 is a black box in blue outline. 227 follows his bobbing shape towards their dayjob. A far away fire crackles by guard tower three, its long wooden beams flicker with orange light behind the outlines of the huts between them. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is late. 227 is grateful for the hour, though her plan was to leave later in the night, closest to dawn, when even those awake are fighting sleep. This is when the sleep is deepest, cold air seeping into the huts, bodies doing the work of insulating. They arrive at a fallen beam. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We two can’t drive it in the ground.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We only have to lean it. It only needs to rest against that.” 227 points above them to a wide and long beam that hangs over where the food is cooked. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“So we tie him to this beam, and lean it against that beam.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes. But first we position this one to stand up and lean perpendicular. If we lean him on an angle, he’ll only fall.” 103 picks the beam up. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Pardon,” he says, nearly knocking 227 over as he pivots the beam away from the food hall. He rests the top of the beam about twenty feet away from the base of the food hall structure.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Come grab him.” 227 is already lifting the corpse’s hands again, tying rope around its wrists. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Where’d you get the rope?” asks 103. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I made it.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You made it?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s husks. Braided husks.” 103 wipes his wide hands over his face, stunned by her simple innovation. “Grab the legs,” she hisses. He shakes his awe and swoops the dead’s legs up. They hustle to the top of the post and tie the body to it. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“He’s ready.” 103 tugs each point of connection. Then he bends low and huffs the man and the attached post to his knee. “Guide beam,” he grunts through his teeth. &nbsp;227 dips under the beam, catching it with her shoulder, she runs the length of it until she has no more space and pushes from there. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Straight towards me,” she says, almost shouting. With a long creak 103 pushes the beam above his head and paces his way to the base of the beam, lifting the body-side higher and higher, until the man is fully in the air, dangling by the braided husks. “I’m footing it.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">227 rests her back against the food court’s fencing, guiding the beam towards her while pressing her feet against its base as it rises closer. 103 is a lumberjack, one strong hand under the next, his shoulder now crammed against the massive beam as he pushes the dead body further into the sky. 227 pulls, 103 makes his final upward lunge, the weight balances above them and shifts towards the food hall. The wood is wet, and hardly makes a sound as it smashes into a resting place. The body is a strange shape in the air above them. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There is a stir of motion by the guard tower. A voice is raising up above the village. A man is shouting. 103 ducks and stays in a low ball. He folds his hands over each other above him. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We have to go, now,” says 227. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I been here a long time.” 	</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I am going to light that body on fire.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You’re what?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“When they come asking questions, you’ll be found out, and then hanged. C’mon, we have to be at the fence line when we spark the flame.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Another voice shouts. It is unclear what the commotion is about with so many buildings between them. 103 and 227 dash along a ditch at the edge of the encampment. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Wake ‘em up!” thunders a third voice in the distance. 227 places her hand on 103’s chest. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s us,” says 227. “Hold this.” She hands him a thin stick with a wet cob atop it. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“This more corn?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes, dipped in kerosene. I took a lot.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“How you gonna reach him?” 227 points behind them to a thin shiny trail. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We’ve been leaking kerosene this whole time.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What’s the corn stick for?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Two chances. First we throw the stick at the body, then we light the trail.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Have you done this before?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Twice, let’s go.” 227 sparks a match and lights the cob stick. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Wait,” says 103. “Let me throw it.” The massive man grips the stick and throws as hard as he can. The flaming cob drifts towards, over, and then far past the body. 227 shoots him a look. “Two ways, right?” 227 lights the kerosene trail, blue flames race along the path. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Look,” says 103. Beyond the moving trail of fire another fire has sprung to life in one of the sleeping huts. “Looks like I hit one.” 227 watches the flame path as it reaches the erected beam. The beam sparks into an orange blaze. The body is engulfed, it lights the whole area around it. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Now,” says 227. They duck under the fence line and race towards the forest.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The same road is here. The same curves in the pavement snake up the hill. The hill is still here, where holes that have served ants and animals are dug and covered and redug, earthquake after earthquake. The animals, are still here, the sounds of twigs breaking in the distance off the sides of the road. The houses have changed, some are raised up, some have expanded, many are in disrepair </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The mailbox is still here, with rusted, stick-on numbers. The air around the mailbox, around the trees, that we cycle in and out of our lungs, is crisp now - for two short months a year and hair-dryer hot the other eleven months. The months are still here, assembled in their unlucky collection of thirteen. The days are still here. The hours pass by minute, the minutes by second, inside the seconds we recall past victories, failings, the tastes of meals and sweat and mouths on our tongues, the memories wake me from my sleep. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our faces are still here, though they’ve aged. We’re the lucky ones. I imagine. There is the collected clothing from past summers and the bags that we carry the clothing in. There is a hard drive filled with photos of all those that were there then, or once here, there, all the everywheres we walked along, to gather. The gloves are in the long latch door beneath the sink to protect our skin. We have to keep from drying out completely.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Your voice is still with me. Your voice from a long time ago, full of curiosity and gentleness, it didn’t sound like that all the time, but it is still here, whispering to me against my pillow at night. She is still with me too, brooding and angry and looking always for some sign that you will come back. I have to remind her when she’s in a fit to not look at what has been left. I tell her we must build our world from the things that are still here.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I think you taste like rat poison when we kiss. No, I don’t know what that tastes like. Save your quick quips. You’re like radish and cigarette, or maybe you’re all Fernet, a bitter aperitif. You wear a jacket like a tattered book sleeve, patches over denim, cologne mixed with rain and mold, a snug fit. You aren’t dirty, but you look lived in. Your eyes are in their thirties. You told me you are twenty eight. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You make a drink in the kitchen while I unzip my boots. We talked about not doing this again. But here is this chair that you tossed me over last time, exposed ass in the air. And here are my naked legs, bare feet against your cold floor, a rash of goosebumps running up my thighs. The rain is loud against the window. My hair is wet from when we spilled out of the cab to your front door.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Here you go,” you say handing me whiskey I didn’t ask for. I’m wondering when you’re going to take your jacket off. You stand over me, twist my hair in your hands and lean in. You open your mouth on mine, slip your drink in. Your mouth whiskey is still cold but it warms my ears, makes the texture of your tongue present against mine. I think of an octopus tentacle as we kiss. I know where you’ll press into me next.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Neither of us wants what is beyond this. Maybe that’s what makes me give into it. You’re cool confidence will be a stutter again, in the morning when I leave. I wish I could whisper, <em>we’re in this together</em>. <em>I’m not falling in love with you either</em>. But you like having power over me. You think I’m obsessed. I’m gonna slip out in the morning and figure out who’s next too. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You have me how you want me. I give you what I feel like, just my body, since there’s enough whiskey for both of us. When I come I think about breakfast by myself in the morning, and a whole day on my couch, under a blanket. When you come I think about leaving, but I stay, it’s the least I can do. I think you need this more than I do, we just don’t know it yet.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Did your mom fuck a tiger!?!” some kid screams looking at my cheetah suit. I dyed my hair blonde over the weekend, part of my becoming. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Who let you out?” snickers someone to a pile of her friends. They tuck their arms under their pits to make themselves look like apes. A boy braises the elbow of a bigger boy and gets smashed into a locker. I grip my backpack straps tight, squish the flat foam into a tube shape. I focus on the squeezing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This girl, Rose, steps in front of me. She’s too close for me to swing around and I have to stop so fast we almost both go down. “Michelle,” she says, “why a cat?” I show her my sharp canine teeth in an exaggerated smile. Then I weave past her. Rose is nice. Nice to me. She really probably is just interested, but it’s nobody’s business what I’m up to. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A hand on my shoulder. Air. Movement. I lift my arms before impact. I crash against the lockers. “Nice outfit.” I look up knowing it’s him without looking: Glenn Turn. He’s waiting for me to rise. I lock eyes with him. I lick my arm and purr while his face turns red. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Turn,” shouts Mr. Redding from down the hall. “Right this way.” I leap up and brush the dust off my shoulder. We’re doing ropes course in gym. I love ropes course in gym, and I’m almost late, so I pick up the pace.</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong>~</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Why don’t you use your tail?” asks Wally, this letterman jacket kid. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Cat’s don’t swing from their tails, you DOOF!” Rose says, pushing one of his cinder block shoulders. “Even if you’re trying to make him feel bad, you’re totally smacking blowing it!” She sits down next to me to stretch. She reaches for her toes with her right arm and leans her head against it, looking at me. “We can be partners, Michelle. I’ll spot you.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I don’t need a spotter. Rose knows as much. But I nod to her anyway. Rose, bites her lip. “I like the hair. I think yellow eyes are cool.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s not a joke.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah, I know.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The coach yells my name and I hop up. The coach looks at his clipboard when I near passing him. He averts his eyes, shakes his head. I anticipate his smirk, so I pick up speed to clear my head. Just when I’m supposed to jump and immerse myself in the ropes I hook left and pick up more speed. Now I feel his eyes on me. I am the fastest boy in school. Probably the fastest boy he’s ever seen. He is starting to raise his hand to applaud. I jump over the cones in front of me. Then the ground is out from under me.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I come to and a lot of faces are looking at me. “Give him space,” says the coach, shooing people away, resting his clipboard against his knee. “The floor Michelle. We just finished this morning, use your head man. You okay? Your head okay? Can you stand up?” He extends his hand, lifts me up. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’m okay.” The class is looking at me. They’re all fit to burst, their grins wide and stupid. Look at the cheetah boy. I walk through them, they tumble and trip out of my way. I hear the coach yell my name, I trace the lines of the ropes like they are glowing. I chart my path through them. The ropes course is flanked on one side by rings and on the other by the uneven bars, where I will start. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I free straddle the low to high bar, my hands lock on. I kip cast to a handstand, my legs pointed towards the ceiling. I can feel all the eyes on me. I let my legs drop and come back up into a backwards giant. I drop shoulder backward to another handstand, then I stoop vault with a half turn over the high bar and release into the ropes. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When I’m in the ropes I keep my motion fluid, swinging my body anywhere I can to not get caught. The bridge in the center of the course is a ten foot long, 6 inch wide plank suspended in air, when I reach it I go into a somersault roll. Where it ends, when I’m in my second spin, my ass will be at the edge - this is the exit to the swinging vines. I can feel every eye on me. I am fluid and spritely. My butt bumps the edge of the board, I have just enough momentum to reach the first vine. I waist no time and jump to the next, where I almost slip my grip. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I let the vine swing back once, tilt my weight backwards with it to rock further forward. I release, make an aggressive path forward, swing from each of the last four vines in a row until I can see the end of the course. The rings aren’t part of the course, but they’re how I’m going to end it. I reach the last vine and kick my legs forward before I release. I tuck my head backwards into a backflip, feel my legs pull over my body, my stomach turns in the upside down, I close my eyes and reach out until I feel the ring in my hand.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I had no plan past reaching the ring, I realize. I just hang on to it and let my body hang straight as a pin while I dangle in a circular motion. I keep my eyes closed until the ring is hanging straight and I’ve stopped swaying. I release, let my legs bend beneath me a little, open my eyes. There is no applause, most of the class is gone. The coach approaches me, Rose close behind me. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Class ended a minute ago,” the coach says. “You must have missed the bell.” I catch my breath, but I don’t respond. “You did well on the bars, Miche. But I don’t get it, Cheetahs aren’t climbers, they’re runners.” I can see Rose’s face turn, like she’s chewing over Coach’s words, preparing to regurgitate her retort.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I don’t really care what I’m supposed to do, coach,” I say, “I just want to know how it looks. How did it look?” The coach taps his clipboard once against his khakis. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It looked cool, Michelle. I could picture a rainforest up there. It was cool.” I almost tell him cheetahs don’t live in rainforests, but I can see he already knows.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

      <title>DARYL</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2019/4/10/daryl</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They used to call me “the kid.” Now I call the kid, “the kid.” He ain’t exactly me, but like, it feels good to embrace him this way. We’re listening to the new Robyn. I tell him we should find the dudes who tour with Robyn and become the dudes who tour with Robyn. I tell him I wanna go someplace, like, someplace where I’m king. The kid laughs at me, ‘cept I’m not joking, even though the idea is funny. King Daryl. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Before any Daryl I knew was a Daryl to me I was my own Daryl, like a king Daryl. Daryl Hall. Daryl Oates. People used to walk up to me, and say, yo, you a real Daryl? I’d be like, yeah, who yous supposed to be? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Bayonne looks like the day after the after party, like some kid sister swept to the edges of a bigger dust pile. The city skyline looms over everything here, even if yous don’t see it. And the smokestacks puff like dad’s pipe did, day in and day out. I picture the old man’s legs spread out across the city streets, folded over each other, thin socks pulled up to just under the knees. And the pipe smoke sputtering out. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Pop called me “the kid.” He’d yell it into the kitchen, or towards the laundry, followed by, “is doing something.” He’d be yelling to my ma, to put out some fire I started, I don’t know. I remember if there was a full laundry basket, I’d hide inside, like a leaf pile, or a blanket pile, and wait for somebody to find me. Dad never found me, he’d just cross those legs if I was hiding, he’d light that pipe and spread the paper out in front of him. Once Pops said to me, after I yelled about living forever, “you won’t always be Daryl, kid.” He was behind a paper. “We all die someday, and then we’re not who we were.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I was like, not who we were? I’d never thought about that. I’d killed some ants and smashed some roaches, but I never thought about not becoming something else. Makes me think of the salad I ordered the day that lady freaked. It was a pay-first situation. You give ‘em the money, your order, then they bring it to whatever booth you’re stuck in. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I was with Pops, he ordered a club sandwich. I ordered a house salad, but with Caesar dressing. Pop looked at me a little funny when I ordered it, but I told him, the house salad’s got more stuff. Then I smacked my hand against my own forehead, and dad looked at me, like, you’re a weird kid, kid. I circled back. I asked the big haired lady in the blue apron, “I would like to add grilled chicken on that salad.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Youwannado <em>what?”</em> she asked me back. Yo, her hair was like an orange cone behind the counter.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I wanna add chicken to my salad.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Let me get this straight,” she said, looking over her black rimmed glasses. “You wanna put a chicken? <em>On</em> your salad?” At this point I just nod my head. “The house salad? With Caesar dressing?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah, <em>grilled</em> chicken.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Sheila,” the waitress yells at some identical waitress. “This girl. She wants to put a chicken. On her salad.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I am real live boy, miss,” I say.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“She wantstodo <em>what?” </em>Sheila yells back.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Wants to put chicken. On her salad.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The house salad? With Caesar dressing?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah, you ever heard of it?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I never heard of it. Louie!” Sheila screams while slowly turning towards the chef in the order-up window. “This girl! She wantstoputtachicken on a salad. You ever heard of it?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No I never heard of it,” says Louie.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well can you do it?” says the waitress.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I could <em>try</em>,” says the chef from his window.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I lean over to the waitress, and tell her, “yo, I am a boy.” She just raises her eyebrows at me, like, sure, kid. When I get back to Pops his friggin’ legs are up on my part of the booth, the paper’s splayed out in front of him. I’m like, yo, lemme sit. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That was weird dad,” I say.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What?” says the paper.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They had a real hard time figuring out I wanted chicken on my salad.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You wanted what?” I don’t respond to him behind the paper, ‘cause like, I’m pretty sure he ain’t listening to begin with. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Couple minutes later, Sheila brings over the salad, looking like any other salad with grilled strips of chicken on top. It looks just like it should, but she’s looking at me like I’m the crazy one. “We had to think about that one,” she says. She places the club sandwich in front of pops and walks away.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Being difficult,” says Pop. “Nobody likes a difficult kid, kid.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I knew I’d prolly have a kid someday. And I also knew, just then, I wouldn’t give the kid grief, ‘cause grief sucks. Yo, and then I found out something else too. There was another Daryl, some kind of kid robot, and that’s what everybody was asking when they were asking me if I was a real Daryl. I stayed Daryl, because Daryl is the only thing I ever knew how to be. And like, what else do you call a thing but what it is?</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The girls are lean. Two toothpicks with arms, legs, and faces. Their communities of bracelets jangle as they gesticulate each word, each syllable. A chorus of jangles. Allen wonders which will take his order as he approaches. The girl with the braid is athletic. When she leans into scoop she braces one arm on the edge of the cooler. Her muscles harden, making spheres beneath her skin. A tattoo stretches on the inside of her forearm. He wonders if her glasses are for fashion or function.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The other girl, short haired, has cat eyes. That’s all he can think to call them, as they creep towards a slow close before she reopens them wide. Or maybe it’s her sharp canines, resting atop her other teeth, that make him think of cats, the way her smile reveals them, as it slides across the plane of her face making two sharp indented lines in her cheeks. He feels a trickle of back sweat. His shirt is dark, a great relief. He’s in love again. That’s twice today. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She’s wearing a striped dress under her cobalt blue apron. The stripes, a light bluish grey with a touch of violet, and a cool grey, almost white, make a ladder to climb up her bony frame. Her hip bones jut out as she leans back with a laugh. He traces the shape of her back and compares it to the spoon in her hand. They are the same shape. The way dogs are with owners. It is a miniature spoon, for tasting. &nbsp;He realizes he’s drifting and lifts his head from its tilt. He can feel the heathered cotton of her dress in his hand. It would come off as easy as a t-shirt, with the spring of jersey. A jangling wrist slides against the canvas of her apron as she wipes her hand against her side. He looks up to her smile, as she asks,“Do you know what you want?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This catches Allen off guard. &nbsp;He looks down at the bins of ice cream. Pastel orange. Mint green. Several swirls. Light browns, mocha, latte. Double dark chocolate. He organizes the colors, the creams, the creams with chunks, the creams with caramels, the neon sorbets. He decides quickly on mint chip. Its simplicity is familiar, and he can already taste it on the roof of his mouth. It’s been years. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He requests loudly to appear firm with his decision. OK, she says in a low playful imitation, squaring her shoulders and looking extra serious. &nbsp;In swoops her braceleted arm. Her long hand wrapped around the galvanized spoon, the ice cream curling into a wave about to tumble into itself inside it. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh,” she says, looking up, mid-scoop. Cat eyes wide. “Cup or cone?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Cone,” he says, wishing this exchange were drawn out, wanting to talk about the colored rows between them. He smiles politely. She smiles back and hands him his cone. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Have a good day,” he says as he pays. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s hard not to.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Allen takes his cone to a banquette facing the counter and sits. He’s always wanted to know what it would be like to work in a place like this. Does anyone ever tire of ice cream? When the kids throw tantrums? These girls are in their twenties, probably out of college - living off of each scooped cup and cone. Tips by the hour. Who’s in here on weekdays? How come everyone is so skinny with all this dairy? He used to drink milkshakes in high school. He’d have to find new flavors to hold his attention. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The mint chip drips down the cone and he catches it with his tongue before it reaches his finger. He works his way around the perimeter of the cone and readies it to be bitten. She’s taking off her apron. She’s washing her hands. Now she’s saying goodbye to the braided hair girl and walking towards his bench. She smiles and he smiles back. But her eyes are fixated past him. She whistles as she leaves the room and the sun breaks from behind the grey sky to welcome her. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Allen looks around the parlor to see if anyone notices this. It’s a little less bright in her absence. He gathers his things quickly, follows her into the sunshine. It is several blocks before he realizes he is following her. A sudden panic of sweat. He looks behind him, puts his head down and turns around.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Marcel takes the underground dragon to get to work. It is a metallic loud crashing, chugging thing. Marcel likes the sound of its gears churning beneath and all around him. Marcel likes the full flood of wall to wall noise. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This morning, not unlike many other mornings, Marcel awoke to an empty bottle of red wine in his grasp. He likes to eat salt snacks and watch quiz shows. He likes to answer aloud to himself in the room. He likes to watch his ants make their paths in his window farms. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Marcel was married for twelve years. He lost his mom, his job, his wife, in that order. Marcel did not like keeping it together or being sober for very long into the day. Marcel liked hitting the microphone clubs. He liked to be quiet until he could be very loud. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Marcel arrives at work where he makes replica binders for a nostalgia store. If Marcel could articulate it he would fill a book with his love for the sound of a three hole punch pressing into and cutting a stack of eight to twelve pieces of paper. He is supposed to press twenty five at a time. Even fifteen is too many. Twenty five papers make a dull thud and risk inconsistencies in hole placement. Four is too few to get work done. Though, up to his own clocks, Marcel would do rounds of threes, sixes, and nines. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Hargret is Marcel’s office partner. She slides the glitter paper into the face of each binder when Marcel has clasped the three rings around each stack of fifty pages. Hargret likes to bump elbows with Marcel. If she could get close enough she’d link her arm through his. She knows he stays up late and drinks. She sees the occasional red lips, and the once-in-a-while stains on his shirt. She wants to know what happened to him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Marcel uses the trigger of each binder to appropriately clasp it shut. Hargret does not like this. The sound is not as satisfying as when you close the three rings by pressing a finger and thumb against the middle ring. This omits a venus-fly-trap snap, which, no coincidence, is Hargret’s favorite sound. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Marcel has a distant look in his eye today. He is not satisfied with the sounds of his three hole punches. He is not delicately placing the paper into the feed. He is being careless. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Do you know,” she manages to whisper, “you pronounce my name incorrectly.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Your name?” Marcel asks, “Margaret?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes,” she says, “my name is Hargret.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Are you trying to embarass me?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No, I’m just trying to talk to you. Geeze.” Hargret takes a pronounced breath. “I just thought it would be best to tell you my name now, rather than later.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh,” he says. He organizes a stack. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I think that we are in this room together for a reason.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You do,” he asks, “why?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I don’t know yet. But, I want you to remember something.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“This is just the beginning.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Listen, I am a divorced person, a momless person, a live alone person. I don’t think I’m good at relationships.” Marcel slides the paper into the press. “So, I’m not sure if maybe you think something else is going on here, but, I am, uh, I just want to do my job.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh, I’m a dadless person” she says brightly, “I didn’t know you were married. What went wrong?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Have you ever seen a school bus fall off a cliff?” He presses cleanly into a stack.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No, that sounds terrible.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s what my marriage was like. Like that movie Goonies, a bunch of screaming kids.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I love that movie Goonies.” Marcel doesn’t <em>not</em> like the sound of Hargrets voice. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I love it too. I don’t know why I used it negatively. That was my uncle’s review. He hated it. And I did not like being married.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You know that I am not proposing to you, right Marcel?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh, you’re not?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Marcel forms a very clean stack of twelve papers, he carefully aligns them under the punch and presses down expertly. He slides the stack over the open rings. Just then Hargret reaches over and grips the center ring to close it her way.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What are you doing?” asks Marcel. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’m closing this binder.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s my job.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“See, this is just the beginning.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Ok. Just, you know, go slow, please. Hargret.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Roderick wakes in a rut. Like there was drinking last night. Was there drinking? No. Went to bed early actually. His molars feel gritty against his tongue. Mouth chalk from clenched jaw. He brushes his teeth without turning the water off between scrubs. Spits and rinses. Then, as he twists off the faucet, he hears the ringing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Just in his right ear is the high register of a hairdryer. This is roughly half the sound entering that ear. He shakes his head, pulls his right lobe down, Pumps his finger against the tragus. Strange way to start. He thinks food chewing, coffee slurping will be the answer.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He makes a cheese omelet and a heats the kettle. Chews pulling his jaw low with each movement, trying to snap the tendons and strings that attach everything beneath the skin. When the kettle whistles for a moment he fears the noise has entered his left ear too. He removes it from the burner. The too-hot coffee burns the back of his throat going down. Across the room, by the front door, he sees his running shoes. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Roderick focuses on the sound of himself running. His feet hit the pavement toes first with a soft clop. Then the rubber peels away from the concrete. His shorts make a brushing sound against themselves. His body pops and creaks inside. Is that a hearing or a feeling? He focuses on the breathing, the hair dryer filters everything from the right side. He stops, cups his right ear with his hand, grabs a cab home.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Roderick throws his keys on the sideboard table that holds the decorative vase. The table was here when he looked at the house, afterwards the owner offered it to him when she sold. “Was keeping it for passed materials while we showed the place,” she told Roderick, “If you like it, it can stay.” <em>And the vase,</em> was Roderick’s curt reply. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Roderick looks at himself in the mirror. He creates another him to start another timeline. “Listen,” Roderick tells the him that just grew out of his body and stepped out of the skin fully formed, like latex stretching, and then snapping back into two identical positions, “protect your ears, no loud concerts. I think they’re to blame.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Do you hear that?” asks Roderick Two. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s why you’re here, do your best to preserve your hearing, you can sleep in the guest room.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The blue room.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We’ve always liked the blue room, ay?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Best to use <em>‘I’ </em>from here on out.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes sir,” says Two simultaneously amused and annoyed with himself. </p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong>~</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In the morning, after running some tests, the Rodericks run into one another en route to the shower. “Listen,” says Roderick, to number Two, “we should establish different schedules, we can’t both go to work today.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’d love to have a run.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Fantastic,” and while you run, “I’ll follow through on the budgets. Want to take the afternoon shift?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah, just leave the tabs open.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Already planning on it.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I know.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I know, right!” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Can you order doubles of all our stuff?” says Two, already slipping on a pair of Roderick’s running shoes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“For sure.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Great.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Watching a late night movie is going to be amazing.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I know, we’re both going to laugh at the same things, but like, more, because we’ll laugh together.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We’ll agree on awesome things.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Because awesome things are awesome.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Just remember.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The ears. Got it.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I love you.” Two smiles at this, as does Roderick. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I love you too.” </p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class=""><strong>~</strong></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Roderick at the office, tilting his head. He’s used to playing music loud, blocking out the sounds of every other conversation in the room. But now inserting the buds in his ears he is afraid, afraid of the ringing getting louder, of total loss on the right side. He takes the buds out. He listens to the chatter of fingers across keyboards, of hoverers speaking at other people’s desks. He can’t think straight. Three more hours of this. He drinks water and coffee aggressively. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When lunch hour arrives he is quick to drive back to his house. Two is at Roderick’s desk upstairs. He has Roderick’s glasses on. He is typing. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Sup, me,” shouts Two as Roderick scales the stairs. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Hey man.” Roderick pokes his head into his office. Immediately wants to switch places with the him sitting at his desk. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“So I made some headway on this jungle story.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh really?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You remember that dream from like a week ago, we made a note. I brushed it off and sort of went to town for an hour.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Okay.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Don’t be weird. It’s ours. Same brain. And you can change things” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But mark the changes.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Of course. How was work?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Rough. This ear thing.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah, it blows, I put on white noise, sort of leveled me out.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Nice one.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Okay, well, we’re probably both thinking about that last slice of pizza downstairs, but, I’m headed out, so I’ll grab a special at the spot.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh, man, that sounds good.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You want to come?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Nah, think we still have to figure out how to like, I don’t know, explain this to people.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Ha, whatevs man. We should go fucking party together, let them figure it out for themselves. Anyways, I’m gonna roll, mess with that story.” Two runs excitedly down the stairs and out of the house and then turns to yell from the front lawn. “Love you, you’re my best friend, bye!” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Roderick looks down at himself doing jumping jacks in the lawn and sprinting away. “Why wouldn’t I take the car?” He turns on the white noise and reads what has been written. <em>The jungle holds a secret</em>, is a note at the end of the second page. Roderick starts writing there, prompted by himself. He explores the jungle’s depths, the crevices under every branch and leaf, the wild life, the dangers, the moisture. He writes quickly, excited to get extra hours in, because Two has already done some heavy lifting. The secret is a line where time stops. The secret is a door or an opening. The secret is a reflection that the traveler will find in a pond or lake or lagoon. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The ringing in his ears distracts him. He looks at the screen and draws a blank. What is Two going to do at work? What is Roderick going to eat for lunch? Are they going to need a supplemental income? What if Two wants to move out? What if they both want to wear the blue shirt? He fills an online cart with all of his toiletries and purchases two of everything. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When the drone arrives with his package Roderick gathers everything half-used in their bathroom and stows it under the sink. He cleans the bathroom. Then he cleans the guest bathroom. He decorates both of them identically. He hangs freshly purchased waffle towels, places new soap dishes in the showers. He knows how satisfying it will be for himself to come home to all this freshness. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A text on his phone: <em>R it’s R, look out for that drone.</em> </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Roderick texts: <em>How are you texting me? I have the phone</em>. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Two texts: <em>From computer, gonna need a family plan!</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The doorbell rings. A second drone drops a box with identical contents to his order. Same soap dishes. Same lotions. Same two pairs of new running shoes. Same same. Roderick knows himself. When he is distracted he browses the internet. He buys tech-adjacent backpacks and fresh undershirts. He buys chip-clips and moleskins and fresh pens. He keeps his pantries stocked so if he is at his computer too long in the day he can always make a quick meal. They’re going to have to communicate purchasing. This type of conversation could really get in the way of this just being all out fun from the jump. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Roderick Two arrives home early from work. He hangs their bag by the front door. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Me, I’m home!” he shouts to the house. “I know that you’re in the office, I’m coming to see you!” Two runs up the stairs, finds himself leaning towards the computer at their desk. “Man, our posture sucks.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Hey, how was work?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Cool, submitted all those budgets.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh, did you account for - </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The answer is gonna be yes, to whatever you’re about to ask. We’re good. Client already approved.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Really?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yup. My drone show up? </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Ha, yeah. Mine too.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Shit. You had a drone?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Same exact contents.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s not surprising.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Let’s just check order histories from now on.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Cool.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You see the bathroom? Take a look.” Two spins and pokes his head into the bathroom door on the opposite end of the hall. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh, babe, it looks beautiful.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah babe, you got it.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oooh, are those the shoes.” Two is back, leaning in the door frame. Roderick is wearing the new running shoes “How do they feel?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They’re awesome!” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Nice, want to go for a run first thing?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes! Oh! Wait -” They both say the following at the same time: “We should get pads!” Roderick and by nature Roderick’s twin do not like lifting weights. The only physically satisfying activity their body has ever found is boxing, preferably with gloves and pads, with an attentive instructor, an exercise that takes planning, money, and usually distance to achieve. They order a drone immediately with new gloves and pads. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You want a drink?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s a stupid question.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We have twizzlers?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh yeah!” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Two boils the water to make a batch of demerara syrup. Roderick squeezes the lime into juice. Two gathers ice. Roderick grabs the shaker. It begins. They toast themselves with their grandma’s line, “here’s to us, there are no better people.” They finish what’s left of the rum after three drinks. Then they have beer and make pasta. They watch a movie. They wake up next to one another in separate rooms. This is three and four. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Roderick gathers the three other hims into the office. “Okay, Two, raise your hand.” All three of the new Rodericks raise their hands. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Wait wait wait,” says Two to Three and Four - “he means me.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Why does he mean you,” says Four.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Wait,” says Roderick, “here’s what we’ll do, which of you ordered the drone.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We all did,” says Four. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But who set up the bathroom?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">All of the other Rodericks point to Roderick, and say, “You did.” Roderick understands that these new Rodericks are spawns from Two. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We’re all thinking it, right?” asks Four. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Don’t,” says Two, feeling responsible for his very presence. &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Please,” says Roderick. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s just a lot like that Michael Keaton movie.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah,” says Three, “where’s Andie McDowell?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Guys,” says Two, “let’s not get into Michael Keaton right now - we know where that will go.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You want to talk about Jack Frost?” says Three.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“About the disappearance?” says Four.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We are all,” Roderick says in an almost yell, “only going to agree. We missed Keaton while he was gone. Looking back we are remembering a dumb movie with more fondness than it might need, that most of the late nineties save for the two Elmore Leonard adaptations were wasted time and not until Toy Story 3 and The Other Guys was the early potential again unlocked. We all know it, we’re all going to follow up with rescuing Rick Moranis from the same fate. We share a same brain, and other than the past 48 hours all of our memories are identical.” Roderick takes a breath. “I will say though, we have to not split into more of us.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Woah, same brain,” says Three, “why?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah, I mean,” says Four, “sort of a weird rule to throw down, now, same brain.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Mes,” says Roderick, “you all know more of us is not going to help - all of us. It’s already going to take some getting used to, and probably a second job to afford this.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And everyone’s gonna want to sleep in our room,” says Two. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes,” says Roderick. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And you,” says Four to Roderick, “are always gonna sort of be like, top Roderick, for being first Roderick. But like, none of us should have to not be first Roderick, as we’re pretty much exactly the same, right?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Right, so like, what this is, for me and Four, and yeah I’ll admit it,” says Three, “I popped out of that one’s body - see, the scar.” Three motions to the scar on Two’s shoulder. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh, and look,” says Four as he motions to Two’s left shoulder, “here’s another scar.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Anyway, what if we want the feeling you guys have had? Since we’re the only us that haven’t produced more us. I, for one, sort of want to know what that feels like” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One looks at Two, they both know what the other is going to say. Three and Four know what they’re going to say too. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Fuck it,” say Three and Four simultaneously and begin to produce more Rodericks. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One and Two press their bodies against Three and Four’s shoulders to push the new squeezing bodies with their latex stretchiness back into their shoulders, but instead, in an instant, they are absorbed. Three and Four look at one another stunned, suddenly the only two Rodericks in the room. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Didn’t see that coming.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Me either.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But like, bit of a pot calling the kettle situation.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah, like, we should agree we’re ours to do what we want with.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Totally.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Want to get a beer?” they both ask one another simultaneously. Three points out the window to an approaching drone. “Did you order that?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh it’s from yesterday,” says Four, “they must have been low on stock.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Nice, just be careful not to hit me in the face. Might knock another me out.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah, and we have to protect this ear from getting worse.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh, wait, do you still hear the ringing?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No, actually, I don’t.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Amazing.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Hey, but like, you agree, four of us was too many, yeah?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh, exhausting.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Totally.”</p>

      <title>Sallys</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/sallys</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Couple of missed streets and wrong left turns brought Sally to Sally. Same names, different haircuts. Cute. Predictably cute. A seaman and a squab. A squab is what he’d end up calling her, weeks later. She knew it was a pigeon, but he said it was the finest tasting bird he knew, and that satisfied any offense from a body comparison. Plus, he was good at sex, and she had never really found that in a man, and so she kept ringing him back, or ringing his bell, and he in turn, kept ringing hers.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She wore her hair in braids, he wore his hair a mess. He wore his shirts tucked in, she wore stockings under short, colorful skirts. <em>Sallys</em> is what they’re friends referred to them as, once they were around together a lot, which was quite early on. The second date was a group dinner with Sally Squab’s friends. They dressed neatly and were experts at movies. He watched their hands roll and tumble and present their feelings as they shouted over one another from one gut busting joke to the next. He liked them. They asked him lots of questions. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sally told Sally’s friends yes, and no, and eventually, after a third frozen margarita, a story of a long stretch at sea, where he was a hired hand, and how he spent two weeks bruising his belly against the hull of the ship as he vomited whatever was left to vomit over the side and into the ocean. It was the relief of defeating this quesiness that brought him back to the boat a week after. He needed to answer the question for himself, would it always be this way, gut to the hull, or was there another side to the sea? He fell in love with imbalance.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They listened to him fill in the gaps, his wide hands motionless in front of him, folded one atop the other. When he finished he rolled his fingers over the cold glass and positioned the small straw to sip from. He sucked the thick lime drink up, dwarfing the cup by his size, as the questions came one after the other back at him, asking more about the crew, boat names, one pretending to know something about sailing having spent a few days on as many boats when he was younger. She kissed his ear that night and breathed into his neck on the walk home. He tore her stockings open from the center. She made his ears ring when she boxed his head between her legs. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When she met his friends they were grunts and murmurs. They twisted the cloths of their hats and shirts in their rough hands as they spoke. They were calloused and sunburnt, with clothes that found fashion in comfort. Perhaps fashion was comfort Sally concluded looking at them all, wearing it so well. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They drank fast and smashed handfuls of salt snacks in between beer glugs. They hovered around her, leaned close as they talked. They pointed their thumbs as they referred to their Sally, patting him hard against the back, elbowing ribs. The bar was lined with colored christmas lights, everyone’s skin was red or orange or green. She pictured the lot of them hovered in close quarters, lit by similar lights, bobbing in the boat, hovered over hands of beat-up playing cards. They smelled like fish, salt, cigarettes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She told a story about hiding her freshman dorm roommate’s boyfriend in her twin bed, under her twin covers during an unexpected visit from the girl named Muriel’s parents. The boy held his breath while he was under her covers until he passed out and they ended up needing to have Muriel’s dad slap him back to life.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sally and Sally only fought after his third trip out to sea. When he returned home he’d been gone a month. It wasn’t about loyalty or distrust. It was just about the silence. He was a ghost when he was not with her. When I am there, he told her simply, not pushing to argue any further, I am there. And here, I am here. I cannot stand in both places at once.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She said, then you should only be here, she motioned to her room, to her bed. She placed her hand against her chest and nodded to him. She took his hand and placed it at her hip. She took off his hat, hung it on a hook in the center of her bedroom’s wall. We don’t need to talk about it again. But when you are here - he nodded before she finished the sentence. She kissed him in the living room, his mouth filled with sea salt and brine, the bristles from his face rough against her lips. He lifted her body as water filled the apartment, as the sea swept them into its depths. They never came back up for air.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Sailors used to visit her. The ceiling would thump above us. They called her <em>siren </em>and <em>port</em> and <em>home</em>. They spoke of her <em>kindnesses</em>, her many soothing ways. They snorted and spit in the streets, puffed their chests like birds walking invisible wires as they waited, their pipes poking the air in front of them. Yet, once they reached our stoop they hung their heads low, they took off their hats humbly, they bowed to us littles. But, once she summoned them they nearly knocked us over to get to the lady upstairs, her change shuffling in their pockets.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They left rosy-cheeked, calmed. After the ruckus, little rings of smoke stretched out into the night sky above us, white and thick until they were just air. We’d look until her hand dangled out the window, her thin arm covered in jangling bracelets, tapping the ash off the tip of the cigarette. We didn’t see much of her, but when we imagined her she was made up, rouged, beauty-marked, her eyes covered in dense purple when they closed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Once she passed us and boomed, “Why aren’t you littles listening to music?” We looked up from our marbles puzzled. “You’re young, you oughta be dancing!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The day the ceiling shook like angry thunder the lady’s yelps turned to screams. Our mother rushed up the stairs. Yells and bellows, muted through the ceiling, turned to stomps and thuds. Then mom walked into our apartment, carrying the lady from upstairs. She said, “off the sofa.” The lady was naked, bleeding from the nose. “Blanket!” mom demanded. But the lady from upstairs shook her bracelets in protest.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Let ‘em see me,” she said. My mom nodded her head just once and placed a palm towards us to halt. When the police came they carried out the lady’s visitor slung between two of them. His face looked badly beaten. His head hung low as he passed us, our open door, my mom leaning against the jam with her arms crossed, still.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mom never closed our curtains that night. She said, “Let ‘em see her, let ‘em see all of us. They like to tell their tales.” Mom turned the radio on. She watched us jump and wiggle. We watched the lady from upstairs roam our apartment from room to room, sauntering, shimmying, sometimes crying all the while. She only wore socks. The floorboards bent and sunk beneath her. When she closed her eyes her lids were caked white like the rest of her face. Black fireworks stained her cheeks from the thick half circles of liner beneath her eyes. The upstairs was silent. My mom leaned against the plaster, her arms still folded. Beneath her skin was bones and blood and insulation. She held the whole place up. The lady called her <em>foundation</em>.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I... am the only one... with an elbow,” whispers Mechislav.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What did you say,” snaps Svetlana, captivated by the slug she’s scooped up in her quest. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“My... elbow,” he is speaking glacially slow, “I am the only one -”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Not true!” she zips back. “Look, I have two. Everybody has two. Everybody that isn’t a nub.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is a quiet night on the shared terrace of Svetlana and Mechislav. Svetlana poked her wet head through his window earlier in a too short robe, ready to salt slugs. An hour later, dirt-filth collected on their forearms they lean into potted plants on their shared balconies. This is usually how sex starts between them. They like to show up asking for sugar in no bottoms. Their signed (and in his case framed) agreement is that even if one of them isn’t up for a fuck than one must happen quickly. If they’re both in the mood they take the night off from other plans.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What I mean is -”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Meschly, How many have you found?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Just the one.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’m talking slugs, you fool!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Have we ever been on this terrace?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“This is your terr - you’ve already eaten it. Haven’t you.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mechislav chuckles, “Eaten what, Svetsy?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“One of these smacking land oysters, you dullard. We were going to make the stew.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I... am not a stew.” Mechislav is a sloth now, a gentle grin across his sleepy-dreamy face, he’s moving slow though he is not aware of his movements at all. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Svetlana screams dramatically, rattles fists in the air. “You are always doing it by yourself, with the door closed. We were meant to do it together.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We can do it together.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh. Nope,” she rolls the little critter between her thumb and forefinger, “you’re having a sexless night, you selfish crab.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Just eat your slug,” says Mechislav. He pats his hand with his other hand, like it is his pet hand.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Svetlana salts her tongue, lays the slug atop it, and swallows while the thing inside-outs its skin, wiggling its way down her throat. The world becomes a green-wave haze. Motion is slowed. Svetlana opens her jaw like a long yawn. If she is speaking or emitting a sound she is not sure what it is. The slug in her stomach feels like a pulsating furnace. She is bobbing in place. She could be aboard an ocean vessel. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What were we talking about,” says Svetlana relaxing into the ooze her body has become. “I’m fluid.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Is tomorrow tax day?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh frig.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What is it?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I have to wear many clothes tonight.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tax day is when the kingdom collects a quarter of all possessions from the year. Knights enter each home, select a portion of underwear, dresses, pantsuits, socks, books, utensils. It is a quiet and non-violent pillage. In its wake villagers are often left with no matching clothing, which has become a standard style, polka dots and plaids, stripes and solids, reds and off-reds. No one in the village chooses what is kept or taken. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Want to smash our bodies together for several hours?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No. Do me quick. My mind is elsewhere.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I… think,” he moves at a tortoise pace, “I can… only go… so quick.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Svetlana impatiently unbuckles his trousers, fondles his testicles while rolling his penis against them back and forth, like spreading dough. He arouses quickly, the tingle more acute and also more numb under the psychedelic influence of the slug. She places his penis in her mouth, feels his body sink. He nearly falls. She catches him, slides a wet finger up his bum and extracts the semen in a quick minute, paralyzing her neighbor-lover. She leaves him sedate staring up at the night stars. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Svetlana looks at her watch. The numbers are shark teeth. “God dammit,” she says to no one. Words are illegitimate in her current state. When she stands her head woozes in two directions, she catches herself with a wall, heads inside to rummage through her closet. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Svetlana’s muddy arms rub against her clean clothes as they fly off their hangers and fling from their folded stacks. She cannot find what she is looking for. When the slug has been in her an hour the fever of arousal sets in. She wants to rub against everything. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She remembers Mechislav on the balcony, his pants still around his ankles, he’s probably sucking a thumb. After they’d agreed on their terms, at an oyster bar between a shared carafe of table vodka, they slipped into the bathroom and used hands only. Later that evening, after he collapsed atop her, Svetlana slipped out and wove their contract into the base of her mattress, between the factory label and the warning tag. Mattresses are rarely taken. The knights don’t like heavy lifting. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Unable to walk a straight line, Svetlana crawls on all fours to the balcony, she stuffs a sugar cane stick in her mouth to clench her jaw against. She sees Mechislav’s body laid out on the terrace floor. He is asleep. His torso rises up and down. She is seasick thinking about the voyage. When she reaches him she is almost ready to vomit, but she keeps the slug down. Mechislav is limp, a little white ooze glistens on his dick tip. The appendage will be of no use to her. She positions herself over his fingers, ties two together with a string and sets them under her, guiding them inside her, rubbing herself until she comes. Daylight breaks over the rooftops of the kingdom. Bells, chickens, markets all cluck to life. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“God dammit,” yelps Svetlana, sweaty hair clinging to forehead. The trip is only half way over, the knights could arrive anytime. She must collect what she was looking for. The blouse is in a pillowcase, she suddenly remembers. She crawls back inside the house. Mechislav stirs, spies her swaying ass as she slips into the kitchen, springs to life after her.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When he reaches the bedroom Svetlana is on her knees, bare ass over ankle socks. She is teary-eyed. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The blouse is too big for me to eat,” she says looking up. They can take any item she is wearing. They can take any item in the house. There is no guarantee that she can keep anything. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It is a blouse,” he says, crawling towards her. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They’ll be here soon,” she says.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Help me hide it.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We cannot hide things.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I want to keep this.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It is a blouse.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Not just a blouse,” she says. He looks at the plain white blouse in her hand, the silk unwrinkled and smooth in its folds. He does not understand the significance. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A knock at the door. Fear in her eyes. Mechislav surveys the two things with sudden clarity.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I will eat it.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You can’t.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I can do anything, I just need to make it small. ” Svetlana watches her lover fold the blouse with great tenderness, though she wishes he would go faster. “Where are your sausage casings?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She strips herself of her top. “I keep them there, in the pantry,” she points to a row of tin cans on a shelf near the oven, her breasts sway, distracting him. “Go!” She opens her door. The knights look past the naked woman to the pantless man behind her, his penis dangling below where his shirt ends, reaching high above him.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What’s he doing there?” asks a knight.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“He is just waking up,” says Svetlana. Mechislav folds the blouse again, this time inching it inside a casing. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That man slept here? Asks the other knight. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No, he fell, I nursed him back to health. He is my -” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Did you report the fall.” &nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It only just happened. That man is my neighbor, he came over looking for sausage casings.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Where are his pants?” asks the second knight.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They fell when he fell.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It is early in the day, it is a reasonable time to be making sausage,” says the first knight. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Do you both have elbows? asks the strange man rolling the sausage in the kitchen. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What did he ask?” asks the second knight. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Asked about elbows.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“‘Course we have elbows. Toss this place.” Svetlana steps back from the door to allow them access to the flat. Mechislav ties off the end of the casing, slips the sausage linked top down his throat. He removes his shirt and now naked, makes his way to Svetlana’s side. The guards begin the removal. “Why did I just eat your shirt?” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mechislav seemed not to look at her at all those first months after they were placed here. One day she fell out of her blouse while leaning far over to pick up some spilled cream. They were seated on opposite sides of their shared terrace. He imagined her lapping up the cream from the tiled floor like a kitten when her bosom slid out. He swiftly rushed to her then, surprising her as much as he surprised himself. He lifted her back into her bra cups. It was as if his only duty was to free her from any embarrassment. She snatched his wrist. First kiss. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The blouse,” she whispers, “is what I was wearing when first you kissed me.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We were neighbors.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We were lovers.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We were not yet in contract.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Mechislav, I am in love with you.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Svet, that’s not a part of the contract.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I know.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I am in love with you, as well.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I know. Thank you.” </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“For loving you?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“For swallowing the blouse. All of the buttons are dissolvable LSD.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s incredible.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yes.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I want you.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’ll clear my schedule.”</p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The longhairs place the eggs atop the stumps. The longhairs do their nude dances around the flames. This is how the longhairs hatch a witch. A witch is a thing that’s hatched.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A wolf is moonborn. They’re a claw in, a scratch to life. The beasts form in a blood puddle, the longhairs dance until the mercury bubbles the deep red to silver. Then comes a spike of wet hair, the form of a back hunched over, and then it’s time to run.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The longhairs’ dance their births in the clearings and hill tops, in the deep valleys. They dance death to life by firelight in dark tunnels. Once they bring death in they no longer find themselves running, they have taken their first steps towards dying. Suddenly they cannot stop summoning spirits.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Spirits wake in the beds the longhairs make. They’re summoned as the longhairs gather the histories while they lay on their backs. Spirits are shaken from their sleep to walk the grounds of their former lives, of their summoner’s current haunts.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When death comes for the longhairs they dance to it, even then. They summon their witch daughters to raise their legs off the ground. They return to the puddles from which their wolves were born. They dip their own feet in the mercury, let the roaming spirits move through them, strip their earthly rags and drag their hair along the ground until it takes root.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Slowly, after the earth has latched to their hair, the bodies turn to stone. Stone creeps into the places where the blood flows, forms ridges over shoulder rounds, cliffs along the edges of the body’s bent shape. The tall stones are left in a longhair’s life’s wake.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The weather rounds a stone’s harder edges over time. When a visit is paid to the gatherings of where the longhairs stood, it is told, if a fire is built and burned, and if an egg is hatched, as orange light flicks off their surface, the stones will dance in place.<br></p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Eddard Volk strokes his beard, pondering. The old buzzard glides his other knobby hand over the keys of one of many synthesizers in the harmotarium, gently, so as not to emit any notes. His fingertips brush against the evenly spaced ridges between the plastic keys, made from molds he himself designed. In fact, there are few instruments within reach that weren’t Eddard’s innovations. He scans the room with reverence, thinking of what? Past glories? A live audience? Any audience? No. His mind is calm, in the moment he forgets himself completely, he breathes as he calculates something in his mind, and though he looks like he might hammer against the keys at any moment, he brushes his legs with his palms and pushes off the floor to float in the room.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Nothing yet, ay?” Vandrick Quill is hovering in the bay window of the vessel’s central room, as if waiting for Eddard’s reappearance.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You waiting on me, Vandrick?” Eddard asks.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Me? What in space you wizard, I’m just having a think!”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Why not in the great space, then?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Ah, can’t be all tied down right now.” Quill lets out a familiar chuckle. Outside the port window the other scientists bob in the infinite darkness of the great space, tethered to the vessel by their long, curling, tubes. Malcolm von Malcolm pinches a worm off a passing rock and with one pronounced chomp halves it in the middle.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Nice to be back home, safe?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Man, Volk, you watch the tape?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The –&nbsp;what did you call it? Boggle?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Boggle. Von Malcolm called it a boggle. Everything’s a blorging boggle to that buzzard.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Has a way with words.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’ve seen dumpsters more inspiring.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But the Boggle, were you scared?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Scared isn’t a fit, maestro. Proper terror. If I had the fluids, I would have soiled my suit. Big heavy breathing beasty like that. Did you hear about the sticky arms?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“No. Tell me about the sticky arms.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Volk, this thing had sticky arms. Stickiest blorging things I’ve ever seen.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“My space.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s right,” says Quill, peering into the room at Eddard’s control board screen. “Go ahead, watch the playback.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Mm,” grunts Volk. “Hard to get a grasp of the whole… thing.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“How do you mean?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well, your body cams are quite shaky.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“What are you on about? You think it won’t do? That old beasty looks clear as day to me here.” The screen is filled with the wide lipped grin of the monster, an upright bug-faced multipede, with suction cup tentacles lining the underneaths of its many appendages.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’ve frozen the frame.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well, that’ll do, old man. Use what works.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Just hoped to see the arms in action.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I saw the blorging things in action, Volk! They stuck Clem! Nearly lost our middle man.”	</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Clem was caught?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Stuck!”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Stuck by the Borgle?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The Borgle stuck Clem!”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“My space. What a pickle.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You joking me?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Just trying to establish the mood.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The mood was blorging running music man!”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Alright, alright, Vandrick. Take it easy on me.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Eddard. You’ve been sitting here for years playing day-long solitary notes.” Volk rests his hands in his lap, considering Quill’s words. “And now look at us out there, dangling like we do.” The other scientists are lost in their own thoughts in the darkness. “But, here’s the take - we’re fresh off a runaway. So, play a blorging boogie, man. Something like you used to. Or something new. But something, man. We were busting <em>out</em>!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Those arms,” Eddard says. Quill squints from his portal window, ready to pounce. “Did they have a squishy-sounding little something?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Yeah, you could say that.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Like something squelchy?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Like a wet mouth.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“In a chewing state?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s it.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Ok. I’m ready.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“When?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Now.”&nbsp;</p>

      <title>The Box Planet</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2022/5/18/the-boxed-planet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Malcolm is alone. Before he entered the maze he watched the first of the planet’s twin suns kiss the horizon line. Even from a great distance the curve of this sphere looks like the jagged open teeth of a zipper. But that was before. Now, Malcolm is inside the maze, and very lost. Entering the field was like a entering a city populated by knee high boxes. The further he and the other scientists walked the boxes the waded into grew. Before long they were up to their necks in them, and then they were swallowed by the labyrinth.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They should have known they were descending. Someone, certainly should have calculated their entry into the below. But, he reasons, none of them have been here before, and with the absence of that horizon line view, came a sort of emptiness within the corridors of boxes, all of which, though neatly arranged, were slightly askew. Pathways indeed were clearly marked out, but the boxes didn’t line up perfectly with them. For the third time in as many minutes Malcolm’s broad shoulder has met a box edge with blunt force.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Malcolm punches a box. It seems to absorb the blow entirely, no sound, even the impact is strange. He isn’t met with pain, and yet, as he runs his palm against the thing, he confirms the roughness of its skin, hard like stone. Where, the blorg, are the others?&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Soon, Dr. Malcolm von Malcolm’s fury increases. His shoulders sweat. He strikes another box. Then another. The results are the same. A softness. A soundlessness. Yet, he feels a familiar fatigue. His arms are noodling, growing weaker when each wall is met with his fist.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The night creeps over the valley. Is it a valley? He really can’t confirm. The corridors seem tighter now. His wide frame brushes more frequently with hard edges. Above him, what sliver of sky he can see through the edges now towering past his sightline is blazing orange. Will the second sun soon set? Has the first one already exited? Looking behind him he cannot trace his path into the maze, and in front of him the boxes have created a dark, looming density. He is met, on all sides by the walls. It is disorienting. The kettle temperature of his being is near a full boil.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Malcolm von Malcolm screams. And now, the unexpected quietude of his own voice truly terrifies him. He turns around to retrace his steps. He has to get back to the vessel. Surely the others will be waiting there. Or at least Eddard. That buzzard never leaves the ship when he’s composing. Malcolm will have a note, that’s for sure. <em>Throw the compositions out for this one. Omit all sound for the episode. Let the eerie quiet take hold of the viewers.&nbsp;</em></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The viewers. He shakes his head at the thought. Who are they broadcasting to? What do they seek to learn here, in this place? Just then, he steps on something soft. </p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We spend most of our lives dulling our senses. We find a taste we like and return to it until we are numb. We follow familiar patterns towards intoxicants: uppers, downers, sooners, laters. We find ways to quiet the noise of our minds.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But, when we are young our only will is to participate, to fill our bodies and minds with every anything, we lack the reason to ignore or stop our curiosities. Here’s what they don’t tell you about time travel, to someone unfamiliar with pain, when you’re too young to know a table is a table, when language can be anything, and learning is fluid, the sensation of leaping in and out of the universe, the act of imploding is excruciating.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For adults, the disintegration and reintegration of your body and cells happens too rapidly to take any notice. You’ve already had a loratadin, some advil, and probably a drink, at midday, before you pass through the portal to the past, present, future.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Unpacking the sensation of time travel, what it feels like for a child, would break an adult in two. It would be akin to an adult’s perception of a shark attack: the gnarly teeth, the multiple simultaneous splitting, tearing, gnashing of skin torn by teeth, jaw clamping through ligament, bones crushing into bits. What is a sharkbite to an adult, a manifestation of all held fear in a single squashing humiliating probable end, the unknown pain is immeasurable.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Picture the frantic mother, a scientist hero to her race, grabbing this tow-headed child by the wrist and whooshing him through the portal. The instinct to survive culminates in twin pillars of pain and protection, the pain of being projected on the thing still forming words to associate with the things that surround it. Picture the child. Imagine its first understanding of the universe beginning at the ability to appear and reappear, to be outside of and back inside of a body, for bones to become particles, and the vessel of the body to be given a magic trick that rips through all understanding of the tangible.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Begin there, while jumping through time, while your mother answers riddles, and upends wrong deeds. Begin there and learn that what is in front of you is real, and unchanging. Have ideas hammered into you that a table is a table, an apple is an apple, that numbers beget numbers. Try to understand light when light itself has gone out and re-ordered itself before and around you. Imagine breaking your skin into nothing, pulverizing your being, and then imagine not waking from, but being awoken to your body’s sudden reformation.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Picture the man, now in his forties, time travel, as it was for his mother, is his only hope, all of our collective hope, for survival. We ask him, ourselves, to face the pain of an entire life, the root of all suffering, to fall backwards into the space of his deepest bodily fear. That is the job. That’s 9 to 5. He named the program Transference.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What else was left to discuss? Beyond infinity, eternity, or dial that back–the day after the event, the week after that–the known world(s) and certain lack thereof. Fear was an undercurrent and an aftershock. Mostly all they could think about was their immediate next steps, not each other, not humanity, a little bit of themselves mixed with the intangibly large what-ifs given to each of them, like a stack of paper plates to tend to while they left the planet, and guard as if they were the secrets to survival, life’s will, self awareness, tying a shoe, all placed on a product that would meld together with itself if it got wet, would tether and disintegrate, would require attention and care to protect in order to not crumble into a different matter altogether.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Malcolm reached a point of overheating, so furious was his mind to keep up with the math of trying to conceptualize all the known things, all the things yet to be known, and what between those to prioritize in packing a medium size carry-on for a lifetime voyage with no return ticket. He fell asleep at the wheel, at the head of the table, with a cup full of caffeine that might be his last. He’d already spiked it first thing that morning, and fell into a stupor by midday, only to go back to solid black coffee by day’s end. The shocking thing was how quickly he succumbed to a sleeping state, his fury seemingly inverted on itself into something almost childlike, a place of peace, tranquility, where spaceships lived on blankets and aided dreams rather than conjuring nightmares.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It shook the other scientists too, potentially more than the news itself, that their most simmering teakettle of a compatriot was so easily able to slip into rest, after all that was laid out during in-depth conversations about the vessel itself, about the immediate and infinite, about the nothingness and everythingness of the unknown world, of exploration, of self-moderation, of all the hopes, all the fears, all the anythings being left squarely in the hands of doctors-turned-actors-turned-saviors to deliver on on a hysterical promise to solve the universe. Sleep seemed to be the only logical place a mind wrapped around an equation so dense could turn. Sleep seemed like the answer itself, even for a moment, even with a duct-taped grip on the wheel itself. </p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If there is breathable air, take a deep breath, a healing breath. Let your apocalypse in. The sooner you acclimate to your apocalypse, the sooner the Sisyphean ball rolls. While your apocalypse has every intent on ripping you limb from limb, it is more accurately a subtle reshaping, a trickle of taking away, the limb is rarely a limb.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Remember, your apocalypse is not tailor-made for you, in that, you yourself, by name, date, age, time, are one of an uncountable many that will meet their demise by way of your apocalypse. But, it’s best for you, as it has been best for your understanding of things, to frame your apocalypse around you. After all, you are the maker of your apocalypse, you set the parameters by simply acknowledging it. This is an act of knowing, living with the breaker of things known, of walls you yourself have built up that will inevitably tumble down in crumbles and torrents, in loose shakes and great waves. Your apocalypse has no need to acknowledge you.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And yet, here is your apocalypse, svelt and bloated, heaving and still, ready to wrap its coarse hands around you and squeeze. And here are you, standing in a living room fully clothed trying to summon a lost thought, in a bathroom, naked, staring at the way the fat pools in an undesirable way above the hip, on a train, bowing your head, gliding your thumb over a glass screen. And here is your apocalypse, waiting, everywhere at once, around every corner begging you to look up. </p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The sorcerers hold powerful rings between their thin fingers, hovering threats in the air, while potion makers cradle viles close to their bellies, and strongmen point crossbows at anything that moves. In the town square to get dressed is a provocation. When weapons adorn beltlines it’s no wonder we focus our stories on the vulnerability of dresses, rest our fears on the exposed hills of a supple bosom. And yet the women are nowhere to be seen when the Wild Man takes pause.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He could swing a spiked club into the head of anyman before they make their move. But, he’s no fool, showing up in the town square the way he is now, exposed. He too is a provocation, what with the fish scale trousers, what with the fish scale blouse. Good thing for the calluses. Good thing for the many years working with these hands, or he too would fall prey to a split of his wrist against the sharp blade of the scalloped pant scales. But what pleasure this armor was to wear in combat, if the spiked club was a miss, and it were he and anyman face to face, the scales would extract excruciating pain.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Wild Man learned the trick watching a lady scrub linens. Any adversary would get lost watching the woman’s arms harden and flex as she worked the washboard, but the wild man focused on the board itself, the wet cloth bunched in the hands moving in and out of his frame, the hands working the garment, the silver of the board foamed over, glittering in the sunlight, as bubbles gathered and slid through so many silver holes.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To be clean this way, to be grated against a perforated, raised blade, the Wild Man took it as a challenge. And being a wild man – putting in the time for the knee length beard, carrying layer over layer over the body for a walk to town, for the smallest errand, being a man seemingly born of the willful effort to be wild – meant that when the thought arose to lift a club hesitation and distraction would be the death of you.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So he surveys the three as he strides into town center, the ring, the potion, the crossbow, ignoring the laughing farmer, armed only with heads of lettuce, ignores the woman leaning into a window to fetch the next hot pie. He keeps a watchful eye, and so do they, they call him Wild Man because they don’t know the limits to his reason. They only see the provocation. </p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After so many years rejecting it, baseball enters your mind, with some sense of nostalgia for it, a baseball bat crack, a mitt over your face and the grass tickling the back of your neck. You left baseball abruptly. A pitcher you were taught to hate was purchased by the home team, and you were asked to justify a villain as a teammate with the same energy you’d spent building a wall against him. This was just as high school began. So long ago. They told you not to mix reds and blues too.&nbsp;</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"></p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Any reason to rebel. Any means to get through. Everybody’s looking for an excuse to let loose. An instructor, he used to stretch large canvases and paint fast studies of family polaroids, said, <em>Start from blurry. That’s best to keep it going</em>. <em>Process is best uninterrupted</em>. A classic insight, like an incisor of an insight, the real bite. Without interruption we can all make the world ours, when there is an absence of obstacle, or trouble, or bruises, and healing. Best to work before the slop up. Maybe the work is the slop up. You were always slopping it up.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><br>Any appendage might spring forth, anytime. You were always afraid to slide in. Turtle shells don’t match up well under the weight of automobiles. Like Boots says, <em>beauty in the cracks of the cement</em>. Here you are. With the turpentine hands, standing over a mess. And the old paint has caked over your jeans. You tried to do it clean a long time. Thought the mess was an obstacle. Couldn’t stop thinking about the mess. What’s that by way of process? In a way process was the mess. Then the mess became part of the process. You’re older now. So maybe you overreacted to that pitcher. But, also, you didn’t want to waste any more time on the game.</p>

      <title>Halved in Blue</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Is it the taste of the water? Because of the water, the oyster tastes this way. Tiny esophagus. Fifty gallon filter. How different can the Atlantic taste, New Hampshire up to Maine? New Brunswick to Sade. She thinks to herself, her own name in the thought, <em>Camille. Camille awoke with a thirst. A thirst for salt? A fly in the room. The nectarines are beginning to turn.</em> Her mother would halve the good side. Make a salad, only disposing of the rot. Like the shells, accumulating over the shaved ice on a tin plate in her mind. Half a clock of halved oysters left, the other half shell-out, the empty white porcelain bowls facing down. She can feel the soft flesh on her tongue, but alas, the coffee’s almost gone.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Camille looks up, from her coffee cup. East, the direction of the sea. Where strong morning light hits the armrest over her spot on the sofa. Like a cat, soaking up the rays, her left arm always tans first. Signs of summer. The windows all open. Loratadine in the morning. Pollen thick and tennis ball green, dusted across the car hoods. City blocks warm to the touch, rising temperatures. Soon only shadows will offer respite.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Camille no longer notices traffic outside the window, no longer hears siren horns or motorcycles. It’ll be better this way, all life should acclimate first to this sound, the sound like a cousin to silence, a cacophony of noises that make a solid. A solid sound. But sound is not mass. It doesn’t matter. She thinks of it this way, a conglomerate, because she hates cacophony, an ugly word, that’s apt for description, but lacking in pleasure of tone. Perhaps this is the point. That this word is meant to represent a thing that is not blended but chaotic. Cacophony to Camille, is a kitchen sink. Things collect, but are never one there, don’t want to be there at all, really. Nobody wants them there in that medium place between buried under food, and safely stacked away.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She loves these plates, each adorned with their single thick stroke of paint, smeared across the center. After the wedding, if a plate’s base paint didn’t compliment the pallete of the dish, she’d search for the right color to accompany a crescent slice of avocado, laying over a split soft boiled egg, and a single strip of smoked salmon. She’d swap the plate she pulled for one with a turquoise brush stroke to meet its coral fish, its yellow sun, and soft green moon.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The baby kicks. Camille straightens her spine, sits upright. Nineteen weeks. Nineteen weeks until it squeaks. Before she is halved and split in two. Camille in the kitchen with her coffee cup, in an otherwise empty apartment, the sun fading the fabric of that one arm of their sofa, the light in the room, the book raised in a V, a sentence waiting to be picked up on, a paragraph needing to be reread. She’ll never be alone like this. Camille will never be alone like this again.</p>

      <title>Tomatillos for the Target Demos</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2022/8/10/tomatillos-for-the-target-demos</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Marigold’s sentences are running upstream, or against the current, what else would you call it they’re getting in the way? They’re taking me, the reader, out of the book. But, it’s easy taking a break from your own brain to visit Marigold’s, rather than forming your own sentences. Easier still to critique her writing. Her energy is right, but she could use half as many words. You feel a sisterhood at this thought, not that Marigold is gonna meet you half way or anything. You’re reading her book. She doesn’t know anything about you. But even the editor in you is met in her sentences, you feel seen in her writing. After all, her book is in your hand, which means it’s been passed around a lot, it’s already made its way. Maybe there’s a sisterhood there too, as you’ve been passed around a lot, haha, but your work has not, less-haha. Many people have already deemed that these in-the-way sentences of Marigold are perfectly fine, best-seller fine, gonna be a movie fine. And maybe you need to show a little more to get the goddamn ideas across.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Should you go back to getting in your own way? You remember a night out on the town at a free vodka tasting for an event marketer. You were the test demographic. You really felt like you’d made it. You were paired with a photographer, a woman whose wardrobe you liked, and when seated opposite her, in the cabin-like interior of a Scottish hunting-themed bar in the west village, you were struck with stalking thoughts. You imagined a violent night of passion, followed by a morning where you filled whatever canvas bags she had lying about with her own clothes.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Before you even met the photographer you had been paired, she was a friend of your friend, the same friend representing this new vodka client for her job, and both of you were essentially hired to be compatible for the evening: two women of equal intellect, plus a night of free booze. At the very least, it was a free blind date, that featured not just a willingness amongst the target demos, but a certain prerequisite wont for getting fucked up. Everyone had to have checked the reckless box on the survey before being omitted to the group. The reckless box was next to the phrase,<em> up for anything</em>.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One challenge during the vodka tastaway day was to make an original recipe with five items from one bodega across the street from the second of the four bars you’d pummel in and out of that day. This was during the sheen-gloss, still attentive, late afternoon vibes where you started, before the fully glossed and sauced send-off dinner. For the challenge, the photographer and you ditched half the group to search the produce. “The tomatillos are ripe,” is what she said, this woman whose name was Mabel, signaling that yes, she and you were in a dance, and yes, the tomatillos being ripe could be applied to her breasts, her thighs, your thighs, your breasts, because of the way she didn’t blink, the way her thin fingers pinched the green tomatoes and her eyebrows made inquisitive but serious peeks and you took in the bone structure that upheld those cheeks. And you said, what about a green bloody mary, a <em>Verde Mary</em>, and Mabel was already nodding, like maybe that’s what she was gonna suggest, and if it wasn’t it didn’t matter, because now the idea was fused between the two of you by her prompt and your proclamation.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The characters in Marigold’s book aren’t going to get together, it’s a platonic story, a whole novel about love that doesn’t end, start, or get interrupted by sex. But, the leads become a sort of yin and yang to each other. Anytime they aren’t tethered they become unhinged. They only operate at their most efficient when together. They end up, like the two of you started, at a drunken party. But theirs ends with angry words spoken in a finite way and the book has to jump five years for them to reasonably come back together. You made it to a fifth bar that night, after the four freebies. You had to pause on 7th Ave to look at the low-hanging moon, a crescent cutting out of the hazy sky, competing with green traffic lights in your peripheries. You with the photographer, already getting handsy, and your mutual friend in tow, all of you laughing your asses off because this was the best date of your life, and it was by someone else’s design, sponsored by vodka, and unlimited in scope. The cab ride home was entirely tongue in cheek.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What happened when you entered her home after the vodka tasting is that she put on the exact album you used to romance women of equal sizes and shapes to the photographer, often auburn of hair, and usually just as fond of leather and punk. She put on this record and you saw yourself. You watched yourself approach with the confidence that this record gave you, you watched yourself crawl up to you and remove your scarf from your neck and wrap it around her own, like she was finishing all your sentences. And you laughed, and almost spoiled the mood, but then you turned serious, and said, this is my record. She descended towards you, and the pleasant drunken darkness of two strangers put you at peace in the embrace of these familiar moves, two creatures perfectly fit for each other’s target demo.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You and Mabel only went on one other date. And since the first one was fireworks, the next one could hardly keep up. Mabel’s story was practiced, not new, and it didn’t matter if you rewrote the whole thing to be daring, you were gonna keep playing the same record too, except now, you might have to rethink it, because suddenly it was clear, in the way you want it to be with Marigold’s book, that you’re always going to be in your own way. And anyway, you didn’t leave victoriously with a bag of her clothes, you lost a scarf that you loved for a night of getting fucked by yourself, though Mabel was better looking, which made you envy her and the fact that any lady she met down the line would be complimenting your scarf on her long neck, and her music cues as they lied down in a bed where you once slept.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Janine in the grass licking old wounds. The night sky plays tricks on the green blades–splitting them black in shadow and blue in the light of the lemon yellow moon. Her mama called it a <em>werewolf moon</em>. She’d make her eyes go wide when she said it and do a frantic scratch behind her ear. <em>A howling moon</em>. Every man her mother’d ever known likened themselves to a wolf.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Wolfmen were easy, by all accounts. A torn shirt. A bent knee. But female wolves, Janine knew, were uncommon due to their swinging tits. <em>Imagine a lady wolfman</em>, her mama once said, <em>out there with titties swinging left and right</em>. You’d be laughing too hard to be surprised by blood when the shebeast attacked. She figured that’s why so many wolfmen. And here’s Janine, thinking the same thing, thinking of her breasts swinging left to right, mounted atop Rick.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Only a month since Rick. Phoebe called Rick “the dick” before Janine and he ever flinged, or whatever you called it. Janine pictures Rick’s sad face, frown-forward, as he said he wasn’t ready, was feeling overwhelmed, that he might need a break. This was after another drunken night, when he said wanna know how much I want it, followed by so fucking much I’m gonna take it, and that he loved being with her, as he bent her over. She fell forward, bottoms-up. His hungry tongue darted around her asshole, as she pressed her ear against the couch and his hands pulled her cheeks apart so much he was lifting her lower body into the air. She was elevating, and then, upon waking, grounded again.&nbsp;Another morning where he could barely smile, or look her in the eye.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Her rough mound calls from between her legs. Why shouldn’t she derobe, press her flesh against the grass before it dews. She’s got dew too, it’s what she makes when she conjures heavy breathing near her ear, like so many ladies behind a door in the movie scenes, waiting to release a scream. Like Rick, crawling up from her behind, and taking a lobe in his teeth, hot wet air huffed-and-puffed in her ear. Maybe that’s why so many wolfmen, too. For all those hot breaths on all those lonely lady necks.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A woman wolf would require clothes. She’d be in a bra, or a ripped tee, underboobs peeking through. That’d calm the giggles in the theatre from the hormone-having boys and the bored, hormone-having girls waiting for the hormone-having boys to catch up. She can see his appendix scar, the crooked line to the right of his belly button, where a fine line led to Rick’s red rocket. She snorts at the thought. The hungry boy that just. Had. To. Set. Her. Free. <em>Who was freed, him or me? </em>If she were a wolf, she’d rip that hot dog off with her teeth.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Janine practices widening her jaw under the citrus moon, while bullfrogs croak in chokes of air–their low moans echo across the pond. Her sharp teeth could come at any moment, she takes a suddenly thirsty drink from the bottle in her hand, thinking of his taste in her mouth, and then washing it out. The wine runs past her curled lips, twin rivers, black in the yellow light, meeting under her chin, rushing over her clavicle and soiling her bra. </p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oopsie,” she says aloud, and proud, just at the edge of feeling a little drunk. She runs her backhand across her lips, and after a taste of the wine-soaked, soft-fuzz of her arm hair, she sucks the ball of her wrist, looks down at the purple stain running down her white cotton shirt. Decides, fuck it. She digs her nails into the fabric of her tee and rips the shirt, splitting the wine stain in two. Unclips. Janine’s breasts fold over her belly. She unzips, slides out of her shorts. He cut the last pair of underwear she had with office scissors, part of his hungry boy routine. Rick the dick, throbbing in her dreams.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She’ll crawl in, on all fours, ass-up to anyone lurking in the trees, a bunch of nameless Ricks, who don’t get to lap this body. She gets on her knees. Tits swaying in the breeze. She lifts up like downward dog, a crawling V, and claws the earth. There’s a mud bed that eases into the lake, the wet earth oozes between her toes, she sinks her fingers in deep. She dips her face in the mouth of the lake, lets the soft thickness of the mud there hold her chin, gives the surface of a lick. Howling would be cliché. Instead, Janine releases a hot stream, marks the spot, to keep the animals away. She reaches her arms out into the black water creating ripples of light across the lake, and frog-strokes, underwater, away.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She swears if she’d stayed on land she would have taken a new shape. </p>

      <title>Red Night, New You</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2022/8/23/red-night-new-you</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It isn’t mine. Was never mine, this place. And yet, here I sit, all red lit in breaklight, thinking I have a tale to tell. A tale for sale. Something I’m not willing to give away for free. Look at the pylons blowing smoke on the avenues that run straight up to midtown, on a night that’s oddly grey, or green blue, inside this yellow cab, even though they’ve all turned lime green –&nbsp;that’s so you know who’s headed to Brooklyn, but there’s not as many lime-greens as people feared –&nbsp;did people fear? They don’t like change, not here on the mainland. The island sits heroic, its own hero, in between a quadrant of feelings, of equal belongings. Everybody’s a native, because next to no one starts here. That’s not true. Just another excuse.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I took a bike to work over the blue bridge. I call it the blue bridge like a badge of honor, like our private secret, racing within the gated pedestrian lanes, so less fancy than the long walk on the more beloved bridge nextdoor. Who am I to talk shit. Icon next to icon. It’s like picking a David. Maybe that’s what they’ll name these two, the two Davids that connect lower Manhattan to Brooklyn. Our babies won’t know we ever called it this. It’ll get a makeover eventually, even if we have it our way. Like the Triboro. Why change the name of a perfect thing, a thing that explains itself so succinctly, a name that announces, proclaims, and maintains its very reason for being. The Triboro Bridge always had a job to do, connecting things one from things two, and things three too. And if you didn’t wanna pay the toll, Willis Ave was always just around the corner.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What’s a hot dog stand but red hot and Grey? What’s a Papaya joint but a dope spot for a late night steak sandwich. I want to ring every scrawny new neck I see, and shout, this was all meaningful, more meaningful, more deeply meaningful to all of us forever before you showed up. We who grew to know every subway stop without a cellphone and learned our neighborhoods by street signs and landmarks and street smarts. Try to keep that bitter pill to yourself. Swallow back. I try to keep that bitter drink up on the shelf, don’t wanna slip too hard and show ‘em what I’m worth. Don’t want to hold my belly anymore, or talk about cocktailing on 1st and 1st.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have a trick on the new moons. When I feel most myself and the boys flock at me, come for my new moon energy. I have a trick about those nights when the sky is empty, and the city is gray on the outside and the only light is electric, when anybody could mistake it for a night when the sky was full – who’d deny the moon wasn’t there at all? I have a trick I pull where I get to be brand new. I press a sticker on my wall, just before I turn the latch and let me out, and the trick is real easy, a simple twist… I’m whoever I want to be.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It’s not my trick, something I picked up from some moonworshippers. I was a temporary member of their coven, or whatever you call weekly hangouts with witches. We liked to howl and scream and talk shit in our knit sweaters and high wasters. We were all really feeling ourselves. But I had to take some exit-stage-left steps when the claws came out, when our cycles merged, the energy became too shared, I started to feel like I did in college, when I left the dorm and everyone else stayed. When I picked up strays and let them take me back to theirs. When I brought home strays knowing my roommate would be across the hall because that’s where they all sat, every night until late, blowing weedsmoke into toilet paper tubes stuffed full of dryer sheets. We were all always fooling someone.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But who’s left to fool? Just fools. Just me, being foolish again. Who’m I feeling, but myself? Quit looking back. In anger. At history. While trying to talk. I throw myself away each month. I clean the slate. But whose slate? Why waste my days worrying about whether people are gonna remember things my way? What was my way? Not enough to change a goddamn bridge name.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I want to do what I would want, bring myself into fruition. I want to smoke cigarettes and drink myself into oblivion, but have enough in my coffers to order a new nutrabullet in the morning, or a pair of heels, or a pair of flats. I want to quit everything and everyone, just to focus on the sounds of my muscles stretching, to hear my own rhythmic breathing, to chant naked on my rooftop, to go back to the witches and burn the ones that cast me out, because I didn’t leave them, I got the distinct feeling I wasn’t invited anymore, and I could hear it in every we missed you, in every Hey Tina, come back. I want to be nothing and everything. I want it all. I want it fast.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But also, and maybe most important, from my place to the bar, from the park to the porch light, I want somebody to keep a light on. I want somebody to tell me the truth, even if it means the end of a thing, just so long as we could both look forward, and let’s say we hated each other, and let’s say it’s getting late, and let’s say we’re saying it straight, that’d be a little more commendable than complacency. Maybe pressing the button one last time would mean no more at-will more-or-lesses.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I have fancied myself a great knower of things. The things I love have changed, and the way I love them has changed, and I’m trying very hard to keep the light on for myself, but I have to start at knowing nothing, I have to believe that I can start at nothing, I have to convince myself that I can believe in undoing, I have to undo every certainty to light this match, to light this way, to forget my footsteps, and all the dumb doors I’ve closed to head home. If I forget me. If forgetting me means beginning again. If begin again holds me upright, and holds me laying down, and holds me sideways. If begin again can mean what it says, I’d shake its hand, I’d forget it all, for a break from this state.</p>

      <title>Plum Knights</title>
      <link>/writes-draws/2022/8/31/plum-nights</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We spent a lifetime tilling soil with our hands, with mud forever caked in our arm hair, black earth embedded beneath our fingernails, and hair clinging to our faces while we looked down and dug. Ages ago, a mid-sized castle in an unimpressive kingdom was passed by, overlooked, and nearly all but forgotten, other than the occasional visit from a farmgirl on horseback, who discovered the castle gates when she was young. That’s how we came to occupy the space, the unwanted place took us in. Well, my grandmother, Mimi, and her daughters before me. We spent generations this way. Burrowing.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mimi’s family had been in this country for a hundred years. Goatherds, chicken tenders, soil tillers. They once had a grand farmhouse, which stood on a hillside, like a beacon. As war parties passed through their lands Mimi’s elders had grown used to offering half of what they stored, which they always insisted was everything. But eventually, the scene was a bit too grand for some famished soldiers. And after they’d overstayed their welcome, they burned the place for sport. Mimi was born in that farmhouse. Her mother too. And like life entering the world, her birthplace was just as quickly gone.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When Mimi and her sisters moved to the one-room shed near the barn, the family stuck their hands past the hay and into the dirt and dug. They dug deep, late into the evenings, their father sometimes still at it at dawn. And one day timber was being brought in, and the next day there was a floor over the dirt and beams forming a ceiling. And just as soon as an underground room took shape another room was dug. And from the ground, surrounded by tree roots and soil.&nbsp; a modest pride grew. They were outwardly poor, but their insides beamed bright with hope.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mimi rarely spoke about the brute she married, only that the sour loaf of a man refused to ignore his societal urges. He was a lamb shank spitting husband. A stormcloud. A thundermass. My mom called him a highground dipshit who liked to sip early to late, whose wide hands were used to grip things and smash them, but those same hands shook anytime he did something small, like striking a match to stone.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He gambled and chattered, talked more than he drank, and drank more than he ate. Only a matter of time before he let slip the family secrets, and once an unknown thing was discovered, there was no turning away the curious. And that is how he lost her family’s farm, it fell into his domain in holy matrimony, which is where Mimi said, everybody got screwed. Rumours spread, the townspeople found an itch they needed to scratch, and sure enough, the next time a war party again passed their kingdom, the well was soiled. In they came, and down they went, and out Mimi and her daughters slipped into the night from one of the various tunnels they’d spent their days playing in, never knowing these hiding games they played were always an act of preparation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Mimi had found the castle as a girl, chasing the herd into the forest. Even then she could smell its stink. A plan hadn’t formed in her brain, but something about the place brought her back to it yearly, to check in, take stock. How does a castle get forgotten? By the light of a waxing moon they darted to the forest, she and her brood. Upon squirreling their way through the gates, they confirmed the source of the sweet, rotten smell she’d known since she was a girl. The uneven ground was covered in plums. Above the plums, a kingdom’s worth of quiet crows, numbed by their addiction to the rotten fruits. What was once a clear path from the gate to the castle door was now a purple and brown marsh. Yet, above the foul ground, each tree stood upright, and in the light of the white sun peeking over the kingdom’s gates, the plum grove was indeed quite beautiful.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My mother used to start the story of her mother with the plums. <em>Only plums, Annette</em>, she would say. The kingdom was plumb full of them. I asked her what that meant and she couldn’t tell me. She said the Brits had argued that being plumb-anything was a misuse of a perfectly apt word to describe the measurement of depth. But, it seemed as ripe a word as any for a place in which all situations dealt in plums. Plums to the knees. Fresh fallen atop once fallen atop plumb rotten plums. My mother would chuckle. She reminded us language is whatever we want it to be. So, stink the Brits.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Years after I left, I’d find out the original trees were gifts from some emperor, and they came with a note that read, “in lieu of oranges, these plums.” Back then, which was pre-everything, oranges were the fanciest of things to grow, all the rage, really, among tree-gifting empires where what decorated your kingdom’s roads, entryways, and gardens had better look as vivid as your best gilded, avian wallpaper. If inside grand halls decorative birds rested on branches, birds extended wings mid-flight, and birds surrounded the outside of bulbous cages, then trees on the outside had better be plucked and pretty, dead leaves scraped away with rakes, leaving that sweet, tilled soil beneath their claws. There was a mild chorus of mumbles when the plums were received, nevertheless, a planting ceremony followed. Sixteen trees sat in two rows of eight, lining the straight edges of the road that led to the castle entry within the gates.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Shortly after the trees were planted the castle was ransacked by a group of common travelers, part circus troupe, part pillaging party. Those who ruled, ruled no more. The rascals that replaced the hierarchy lived in the castle for a time, resting on the bones of the recently departed, and then abandoned the place, leaving the plums to overrun the gated grounds. This last part is my own speculation, there’s no written history between the kingdom that was gifted the plums, and what exactly happened to them.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Years passed. Wars tore through larger nation-making kingdoms. Large armies were amassed and defeated and victorious. During these years the walls grew thick with ivy, and the forest surrounding the castle gates hid its grandeur from plain sight. When Grandma Mimi finally decided it was time to breach the gates, she found an illusion in the ivy wall, which was actually a passage.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My grandmother and her three daughters made nests of their rooms, spun tapestries on looms, and colored everything in vibrant hues of orange, red, and purple. They made a house sigil of four crows surrounding a single plum tree. She liked to say they were all crows now. And after seasons of cleaning the grounds, they looked up, and enjoyed the bounty of their orchard. But Mimi hardly paused. She moved the work outward. By moonlight, each night, she and her daughters slipped outside the gates to dig. Your grandmother, my mother used to say, couldn’t keep her hands clean a day in her life.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">She didn’t say what the digging was for. She didn’t trace a path or acknowledge a motive. But, the trench was her gift to us, a ring embracing the castle gates in a hug. She was determined to keep her home and have her children raise their children in the freedom of this plum kingdom. My mother and her sisters, their only memory of men was their father’s teeth tearing through meat until they met bone. The smell of ale. His rosy cheeks, glowing to a boil from the calm demeanor of his third pint to the agitation that rose after his fifth, which was always when they blew out the candle lights.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">So when Mimi’s middle daughter went beyond the castle gates, she did so quietly, without pageantry. She did not return for two months. Then, one day, her sisters woke to find her walking in the orchard, a bruise the color of their house-fruit on her face, a pridefulness in her step, a renewed elegance to her walk, the way she drew her shoulders back from her chest. She returned only after confirming she was with child. Her sisters excitedly tended to her and grew envious. Before long they’d all leave and return carrying a child in their bellies. Their suitors would remain unknown, not asked about, not worried over, and just as soon forgotten.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When we were born, we were crows too, but also plums. Mimi would pluck a word out of the sky and that’s what she’d call us that day, whenever she was done digging, with a muddy foot soaking in a tin of boiled water. <em>Croaks, Toads, Minnows, Leaves, Songs</em>. We answered to any name she sang. She’d filled the plum castle and taught us to stock our cellar with barrels by the end of fall, and bottles every spring. As for the crows, rituals were made of their deaths and our feasts, and their feathers were sewn into wreaths and tapestries, that oil slick blue-black shining the way blood does in pools, rich and syrup thick.&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align:center;white-space:pre-wrap;" class="">~</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When it was my time, I said my goodnights to the cousin-sisters. I’d worn my swimming suit all day, beneath my dress. I folded my clothes over boots and placed them carefully into a basket I’d lead across the moat that had formed from the trench. If there were one hundred of us, we wouldn’t reach from one end to the next holding hands. Swimming was the only way to the other side.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But, as I slipped through our passageway that night a clumsy commotion froze me mid-step. Imagine me, a pale naked leg bent at the knee, and a searching arm bent at the elbow, like the arm and leg of a K reaching out from an unseeable slit in a wall of ivy. The wall was birthing me, and in a single stroke my stupidity would cost us our kingdom. I couldn’t stay inside. I crept my head past the fold to see if I could get a sense of what awaited me beyond the gate.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">My mind calmed upon seeing the armored knight hanging from his horse by a leg, body dragging against the dirt, head trapped in its ridiculous pointed helmet. The knight flailed and the armor’s metal arms searched beneath him to right his position or fall completely off the mare. He couldn’t have seen me with that helmet. But I couldn’t look away. I emerged from the wall and crouched behind a bush. Watching him twist, the sound of the metal scraping against itself, was delicious. I wanted to make a sport of it, pummel him with plums. But with a sudden thud, he was free.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I saw you.” He pointed towards the wall, but not in my direction. “Come out!”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s impossible that you saw me,” I replied from the bush. “I was never really here.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I see you now, sitting there, behind that bush. We’re talking.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Very well. I’m here if you say so. What brings you to this place?” I asked, standing up. The knight did not respond. “What are your intentions?” I demanded. Silence. “I can play this game too.” I crossed my arms, the night cool against my bare skin. I’d spent eighteen of my twenty-four years digging mud from the depths of our moat, waiting for some reason to validate its existence. I wasn’t about to cross the water only to land in the metal arms of this fool. “It’s very late, sir. Perhaps it’s time to climb atop your horse and go.” The knight stared back at me, silently. “Do you have anything to say?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We’ve watched this castle for months, from afar.” That word, <em>we,</em> beat a drum in my ears. My heart became a fist hammering beneath my chest. I was a twin pulse. My face grew hot as I clenched my jaw. “To what kingdom does this place belong, what’s beyond these gates?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s difficult to speak this way,” I said, stepping out from behind the bush, making sure to present my legs with each step. My mother asleep behind the gate. My grandmother. My aunts. My cousin-sisters. “I’ll cross now, so we can talk.” I placed the basket in the water carefully and waded in behind it. The mud floor of our moat cradled my feet in its thickness. I spread my toes, letting the earth fill in every gap, planting each foot before taking the next step. These women, my family, we dug our trench deep, and with one steep drop, the water quickly met my chin. 	</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As I made my first steps onto the mainland, which felt more like an island than our own tiny kingdom, the smells hit me, standing closer to the trees than I ever had, the crisp air and savory scent of pine, mint, and wet leaves. I’d looked at these beauties all my life, stretching towards the sky, but I couldn’t focus on them so close. I kept my gaze locked on the thin slits in the knight’s helmet as this metal-clad person approached me, the animal braying behind him, looking cold or frightened, or both.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Are you going to take that ridiculous helmet off?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“A knight does not reveal its face.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Unless what?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“There is no unless.” I scoff at him. I grew up in a castle of sister-cousins.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“There is always an unless,” I replied, taking a step closer, looking for eyes beneath the lines. I reached my hands to his helmet. We were taught to act with intention.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Another move and I’ll cut your throat,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“With what, that big heavy sword?” I positioned my bare feet to the right of each of his. My breasts met his armor, and it sent a chill down my spine. If he fell towards me I’d be crushed, so I centered my pelvis, and gripped the ground with my toes to keep balance. “I doubt you could –” He tried to cross his right arm between us, reaching to his left side for the sword. I grabbed his wrist swiftly, forcing it groundward while I palmed his right shoulder down too, then swept my leg to the back of his knee, to make it buckle.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He fell with a clatter, twisted into a pile of metal. “Don’t start with swordplay, when you’re dressed that way.” I leaned over him and lifted his sword.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“There are rules of combat.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh really? Are there rules for self-preservation?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I thought your castle gates would be swarming with men.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Men? What, eating forkfuls of sausage? Smashing steins?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Protecting their secrets.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“So you’re surprised then, to find a woman?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Not as surprised as my camp will be.” Violence and threats.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You remind me of my grandfather. I imagine your camp, they’ll be thirsty to find a castle full of women, no?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“There are more of you?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh my. Of course. A kingdom. Haven’t you heard of us?” I rest the heavy sword on my shoulder to support the weight of the thing, but I make it seem casual. “Why did they send you alone?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They don’t know that I’m here.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“A silent scout.” I nod back towards the castle gates. “They don’t know I’m here either. So what should we do now, the two of us, under the moon alone, while nobody knows we’re anywhere?”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I could take you prisoner.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“God. Is that all you want?” This tin man, this cock without imagination. I was hoping he might save me the trip to town. “You know, if you were to take off your helmet you might see a bed of leaves over there. Looks softer than all that metal.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Oh? Is that a yes? Do you know how to get yourself out of all that armor, or do you keep your code in sleep too?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“‘Course I know how to remove my armor.” Tending to the dipshit before me, I kept my ears trained on the distance, listening to the forest. How near might the rest be? He’d only removed a gauntlet. I was getting impatient.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Here,” I offered, and helped remove the first sleeve, revealing a scrawny pale arm beneath. The frame was a ruse, covering a boy beneath. An easy first. He continued, placing each piece of metal carefully on the soft ground. When he was through he met me on the bed of leaves, still wearing the helmet. I cradled a petrified crow talon in my palm, pressing the claw into my own skin to test its sharpness. “So, keeping the helmet on, then?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“A knight does not –”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I remember.” I circled around him. “Well,” I said, resting my free hand on his naked shoulder from behind, “a lady doesn’t spread her legs for a faceless man.” Then I neared close to the helmet and whispered, “I won’t tell anyone.” I could hear him swallow. Then he raised his arms to cup either side of the helmet, and the moment he lifted them my talon was there to meet his neck. I sliced the skin deep and watched the blood speckle and pool over the leaves. I caught the helmet by its feathers before the faceless knight fell limply to the ground. I turned him over to have a look at the thing. I’d only read about his parts.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I wanted so much more than this. My first man, a hapless foot soldier. But there were others out there and a body to dispose of. I shoved the bloody leaves into his chain-linked under-netting. I dragged his dead legs to the shoreline of our protective circle. I emptied my baskets, tore strips of fabric from my dress, and tied rocks to his wrists, his ankles, his midsection. Then I waded into the center, dragging his dead weight behind me, this nameless creature who died with less grace than our crows.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I turned back to the shore, to the carefully placed armor. I sat and slid my calves into the greaves, wrapped the cuisses around my thighs. The metal cut into my legs, forcing me to move in awkward pivots. I slipped the breastplate over my chest, maneuvering it into the proper position when a voice rang out.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You gave him too much time.” My mother. She echoed across the moat.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You been there a while?” I asked.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Long enough,” said my mother. “He got closer than most.” I didn’t have time to respond. “You think he’s the first visitor that’s crept up to our gates?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“But you never mentioned–”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We needed to make sure you girls slept at night, without fear of the forest.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I could never fear this forest.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“You should fear it, Annette.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’ll need to make that decision on my own.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I know.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Get back inside, Annette,” my mother’s sister shouted from somewhere behind the wall. “You’ll freeze your tits off.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“How many of you are back there?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Everyone’s back there,” my mother said. “All your elders.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And my sister-cousins?”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They’re asleep, of course.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“More will come,” my grandmother said, at last, her voice frail now in her old age. “Armies don’t disappear. Men seek out what is left unanswered, to stamp out every flame.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“Well then,” said my mother, perking up, “best to save that armor, should we need it.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It’s dreadfully uncomfortable.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“We can fix that,” said my mother. “There’s no need to be a hero out here on your own, my love. We’ve never needed saving.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“There will always be plums,” said Mimi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And crows,” said my aunts in chorus.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“And the world, spinning in place,” said my mother.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I’m still going,” I said.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“I know you are,” my mother responded. “You were always going to.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“This helmet smells like shit.”&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“They always do,” laughed Mimi. My grandmother appeared then, stepping out into the purple night beside her middle daughter. “Now go fly. Be a falcon, lovey. If they ask who you are, tell them in a low grumble.”</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“The Plum Knight,” I say.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“That’s right,” said Mimi.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“It was always going to be you, too,” said my mother.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">“How do I mount that thing?” I asked, and the women of my kingdom laughed and laughed. I fastened the gauntlets over my wrists, all of their eyes watching me. I placed my foot in the stirrup and failed to mount the mare until my third attempt. But that didn’t stop them from watching either. I disappeared into the forest, carried by the gentle breaths of my protectory, a kingdom of plumb eyes at my back. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>Space People is an ongoing adventure story about a crew of otherworldly male scientists that abandoned their home planet on the eve of its destruction to explore the infinite pockets of space. The so-called smartest of the smarties failed, however, to include a single member of the opposite sex on their voyage. Lost, listless, and lonely the men drift across the endless night sky gathering space dust for nutrients and space worms to drink from. They contemplate their place in the great space while their bodies evolve to existence without gravity.&nbsp;Their torsos are an open box straight through the center of them. Their limbs stretch and expand.</p><p>Not until they decide to explore other worlds do they realize gravity is no longer their ally. Finding themselves borderline useless on land their existence in the world is complicated even further.</p><p>We will be sharing excerpts of the adventure from time to time here, on this website, because the story has worms in it. <em>Of course it has worms in it.&nbsp;</em></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <h1>2. THEN THERE WERE FIVE</h1><p>Xander removes his calculator and sends coordinates to the others. Qelvin is gone, his tubes wave limp and bodiless off the vessel, unaware of their host’s disappearance. The men stare past the absence of their partner into the unrelenting universe. Now they are five.</p><p>Xander and Tate swim to the vessel. The others continue to dangle, scratching their heads. These men learned many years ago that there is no rush, to anything, at all. If they are grieving, then grieve they will. Or perhaps some are simply not done with today’s stretching.</p><p>Xander has an oval shaped head, hairless face, his oily black hair is always perfectly parted in the mornings, before exiting his bunk. His wide eyes can slip right into the core of a beast if one locks into them for too long. He is younger than the next scientist by a decade, and, three dozen years younger than Tate, the eldest member of the consortium.</p><p>Antigravity is a tricky yorik, or so they’ve said. Tate remembers a time when any direction he bent was a relaxation, but now, it is all a struggle. He misses the weight of the world, the force of being pulled towards something. He misses the sight and smells of his beloved farm. Yet, he is mirthful in conversation with his fellows, excitable at the extraordinary wonder of their surroundings, always patting his shiny bald head and brushing his hands through his white moustache.</p><p>The conference room, once filled with a long table and chairs is now empty, its walls lined by drawers. The floating furniture proved to be very difficult once the vessel’s gravity-inducing mechanism failed. They sent the furniture out to float as they do in the great space. Xander and Tate hang off bars they mounted to the ceiling.</p><p>Tate: What in space?</p><p>Xander: A darkness is upon us. That is no joke!</p><p>Tate: Is he -</p><p>Xander: He’s gone. Vanished.</p><p>Tate: Dead?</p><p>Xander: Oh! Most certainly, Tatey. Swallowed up.</p><p>Tate, cups his bald head with his whole palm and slowly rubs it from above his eyes to the crease in the back of his neck.</p><p>Tate: Swallowed up.</p><p>Xander: Snatched.</p><p>Tate: My goodness. What in space?</p><p>Xander: It was just darkness that took him, Tatey. An absence of stars.</p><p>Tate: What in space?</p><p>Xander: Indeed. &nbsp;</p><p>The three remaining scientists gather within the vessel. Eddard, the resident sound engineer and composer, removes his headphones, ruffling his thick mane of hair, unzips his suit, goes about his nightly activities. He feeds his roaches, puts on a large robe with many fastenings, and covers his space. Even after all these years he is still shy about the hole in his gut. He feels like people can see through him, which, they certainly can. He runs his fingers through his lavender beard, and combs his wild hair, He is keen, even here, on keeping up appearances.</p><p>For the first two years Eddard composed playful melodies to soundtrack their wake and sleep cycles. Their sole expedition off the vessel, an unspeakably bleak event, threw him into a deep depression, overtaking the mood of all his tunes. Eddard retreated into the deep space in his mind as the emptiness expanded in his belly. Long dissonant notes, sometimes one note per day, started to drive all aboard the vessel mad. The crew insisted he unplug his noise boxes from the internal speakers system and compose with his headphones from there on out. That was 70 years ago. Little did Eddard know, that even before the public outcry, they’d already dismantled their ear-speakers, opting for silence even between one another during their floats in the great space.</p><p>Malcolm, the moodiest among them is fuming mad, but says nothing, which surprises no one. He sulks his way to a far corner of the conference room, arms crossed, avoiding eye-contact with the other scientists, offering the occasional humph or grunt while the others proceeded.</p><p>Vandrik Quill makes a final loop around the vessel now that everyone else is inside, to inspect his ship. He tinkers with a bolt and presses the buttons that suck the feeding tubes and tentacles in before shooting through the entry-port, eyebrows raised with a passion long absent among the men, a finger pointing as he shouts.</p><p>Quill: What in space is going on out there?</p><p>Xander: Indeed.</p><p>Tate: He was simply swallowed.</p><p>Quill: Great space!</p><p>Quill adjusts his eyeglasses.</p><p>Tate: What in space!?!</p><p>Xander: Indeed.</p><p>Quill: I say we find this darkness. I say we light it up!</p><p>Xander: You saw?</p><p>Quill: Of course I saw. Our man - swallowed up like dust by a great big nothing, more nothing than all of this… NOTHING!</p><p>Quill outstretches his arms to either side like the wings of a winged thing.</p><p>Quill: He’s out there, and we’re in here. So we’d better start looking for the dark.</p><p>Xander: Certainly you don’t think he’s alive?</p><p>Quill: Alive?! Of course not. But that doesn’t revoke our badge to catch that darkness!</p><p>Xander: My space, man, what’s got into you?</p><p>Quill: X pronounced Z!</p><p>Quill places a hand gently on Xander’s shoulder.</p><p>Quill: We haven’t had a reason to stay afloat this long. It’s been decades! Forty years since the passing of the Pink Qwhale! Don’t you remember a flesh that isn’t worm’s meat? Our man is out there, eaten! What in all of blorging space are we doing out here? Hmm? I, for one, am not going to settle on this life afloat.</p><p>Xander nods approvingly.</p><p>Quill: So, let’s set a course for that combed planet, for a start.</p><p>Tate: Yes! And let’s get some good sleep while we -</p><p>And like that he pulls the valve in his neck and is instantly asleep, afloat.</p><p> </p><h2 class="text-align-center"><strong>VALVING IT: YEAR ONE</strong></h2><p class="text-align-center"><em><strong>An Introduction to Space Sleep</strong></em></p><p>Before they made their grand exit, Quill designed a valve to induce deep sleep. This twistable knob tapped into the neck of each scientist, which when tugged, sent the traveling scientists instantly to a deep yearslong sleep. However, after their first misery of an expedition, the scientists started using the valves recreationally, to dull the pain of the memories. Soon all aboard came to depend on the valves for any deep sleep at all, their bodies untrained to the floating. Tate’s move, invented after their first long sleep, is to dramatically tug his valve mid-sentence during a conversation and conk out on the speaker:</p><p>Malcolm: Great space! How long were we asleep?</p><p>Quill: Years!</p><p>Malcolm: Yes, I remember years. But how many?</p><p>Xander: I feel like I’ve been buried alive.</p><p>Quill: Two years.</p><p>Eddard: Not so bad. Two.</p><p>Qelvin: How many is that back home?</p><p>Tate: Eight.</p><p>Xander: We’ve been asleep for eight years?</p><p>Malcolm: Two years.</p><p>Tate: Yes. Two. But also eight.</p><p>Xander: Blorg me.</p><p>Qelvin: Anyone else have dreams? I dreamt of marvelous juggs. I was surrounded by them. They were closing in on me, like a chase, in a game, where you can’t wait to be caught. By the juggs.</p><p>Eddard: You dreamt that for two years?</p><p>Qelvin: Eight years!</p><p>Tate: My goodness.</p><p>Qelvin: Did you dream?</p><p>Malcolm: Yes, I dreamt we were afloat, in space, but we forgot something on our planet that we needed.</p><p>Eddard: You’re in a rotten mood.</p><p>Malcolm: But what was it? Oh. Yes. Women. We forgot -</p><p>Eddard: That’s enough.</p><p>Tate: This valve really did the trick. How many sleeps do we have left?</p><p>Xander: How do you mean?</p><p>Tate: What amount of medication did we come equipped with?</p><p>Xander: Well, it isn’t a medication actually.</p><p>Tate: How’s that?</p><p>Xander: It’s just, Quill, help me with this.</p><p>Quill: Yes, it’s actually just a valve. The valve shuts off the flow of cortisol and induces a rapid rise in melatonin. That plus weightlessness produces an instant sleep. Then we made some adjustments to some neurological frequencies, also connected to the valve, and voila! Sleep city.</p><p>Tate: So all I have to do is -</p><p>All: Tate!</p><p>Tate pulls the valve and is instantly asleep, floating amidst his colleagues.</p><p>Qelvin: What in space?</p><p>Xander: He just conked out. How long will he be out?</p><p>Quill: Two years.</p><p>Xander: What? Is there anyway to wake him?</p><p>All: No!</p><p>The men all start laughing at this.</p><p>Eddard: The old boy’s just valved it!</p><p>Xander: Indeed.</p><p>Qelvin: And if I pulled it slightly less forcefully -</p><p>Quill: No! Qel -</p><p>And off goes Qelvin. Tate and Qelvin float in place, their mouths agape, and eyes comatose until the men drag their weightless bodies to their bunks.</p><p>Quill: Well, first things first, we may want to adjust these valves.</p><p>Xander: Indeed.</p><p>Quill adjusts the valves to induce a more gradual, intoxicating wooziness. Once discovered, this becomes abused, almost instantly.</p><h3>Except, nothing happens in an instant here.</h3><p>The scientists spend their first several decades afloat addicted to valving it.</p><p class="text-align-center">~</p><p>The men collect Tate’s floating body and arrange him within his bunk. For all their years afloat the ritual of cleaning up Tate before his body gets tangled in someone else’s is probably equal to the amount they sedate themselves on gentle tugs on the valve mixed with the rot of worms.</p><p>What was long understood, before taking this journey, before their bodies evolved in plain sight, was that there would at least be worms here, as there are in the dirt back home, that if there’s one thing that is universal throughout all of space, is that there are always worms, and worms live to drink, and the sweet rot that lives within them is an intoxicating agent to these beings.</p><p>Tate would often reference the sweet worms of his youth and the bootlegging his family would do as a side business to their farming. “Anything that grows can be farmed,” he would often tell the men when they were at their lowest galaxy drifting moments, reminding them there would one day be land for them to plant seeds, and worms to gather from the soil, and bottles to fill from their innards, and drinking to be done until morning.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <h1>1. ALWAYS AFLOAT</h1><p>Today is Xander Clem’s one hundred-twelfth birthday. He floats in the darkness of everything surrounding him and his companions. Numbers rattle in his brain, he visualizes lists and times tables, concluding that if his planet were still a planet, if they didn't depart it on the eve of its destruction, if they'd landed somewhere else, he would be dead, or well into this life’s fourth century. He looks at his compatriots as they drift. They are alone out here, too scared to risk their lives on expeditions, terrified of the unknowns that creep in the eternity of the great space.</p><p>As scientists they have failed this expedition’s pursuits. Though they survived their planet, they have given up on knowledge. They live on the intoxicating nectar of worms, their sole source of liquid, thirsty for a glass of anything else, perpetually drunk, dehydrated, lethargic to the infinite possibilities that fill their periphery. Xander’s birthday marks another forgetful year of space worms and space dust, collected by the vessel and pumped into their feeding tubes. They drift, like buoys, &nbsp;tethered to their spherical ship by pairs of occasionally knotted tubes, the only object in the universe they can rightfully call home. The six men are adrift in the wilderness of the great space. Black skies, white stars, illuminated gases, and occasional planets fill their horizonless lines of sight.</p><p>Space. All things exist within and around it. Their spaces were once held together by ground and space itself defined their bodies into parts, their lands by marks, maps were separated by roads and buildings and forests. The world was grounded. Here, the map has spread out, space is now the cubic volume of infinity, measured on an always moving channel of axises. Here, their bodies, constantly pulled in all directions, have adapted accordingly.</p><p>Though it was designed with a function to simulate gravity, once afloat, their vessel lost power any time they attempted it. When they gave up on gravity they used any number of tubes to tie one another down just for the sensation of friction. They’d spend days in what they now called a day convincing themselves that some mock gravitation towards a surface would eventually calm their insides. But strapping oneself to a forever twirling sphere only induced the sickness quicker. Tired of cleaning the vessel’s walls and drawers during all waking hours, they forfeited these pursuits.</p><p>These six men have witnessed their own evolution while afloat. Space has made its way in and through them. A cubic window, a passageway, a square hole has opened through the center of their bodies and expanded to the far reaches of their torsos. When the spaces were new, the men imagined the hilarity of losing a set of keys near a kidney or some other now-less-useful organ. They joked about their evolution for a time, but time won.</p><p>Xander’s one hundred-twelfth marks seventy-two years afloat, weightless, and worldless. Seventy-two years of false starts and non-starts. Seventy-two years of lengthy conversations about the nature of their evolution. Millions of revolutions with no revelations other than that they are thirsty, they are cold, and they are still not over leaving all of the women behind.</p><p>Their planet would make precisely four rotations in their current space day, making the men well into their 400s now, back home, should back home still exist. This fact was keenly observed by the quickening in pace of the scientists’ wristwatches and by the accelerated speed a world takes on when they are perpetually moving in slow motion past it. After witnessing their planet collide with all those falling rocks they decided to abandon traditional measurements of time aboard their forever floating home, urging one another to strip each wrist of a ticking clock and forget about what age they may have been once.</p><p>They merrily cheered this over the course of several old days in a current single day, which felt like several hours, and then they returned to drifting. Young Qelvin, however, glued his wristwatch, with its rolodex of days and dates, to the ceiling of his bunk, to keep home close, for as long as he was drifting. Old Tate, made a tally of days within days, and formulated a calendar in reverence to what was. Eddard made a map of the seasons back home, and above the map he layered sheets of translucent plastic, that represented months, sixteen squares in total to track the old time. And Xander too marked months every seven or eight days, to keep a loose grip on the past, each of them silently toasting the new year every few months with a wink and a hug.</p><p>They each were picked based on certain criteria, a shared heightened mental ability. Certainly they knew it was coming to an end: their planet. They all remember Quill being quite keen on that fact. The flood waters rising and what-not. Of course they weren’t coming back, each of them knew that going in. Yet none could remember prior knowledge of the meteor shower that made asteroids of the whole damn place. Xander’s precious animals crumbled to bits. Malcolm’s trees, burnt to a synder, all over again. Eddard’s discography, forever forgotten. Qelvin’s lenses, Tate’s farm, Quill’s hangar, where all this was dreamt up: Gone, gone, gone.</p><p>~</p><p>Xander watches Qelvin stretch, there is hope in the movements of his twisting body. “When the day comes,” Qelvin is forever saying, “I’ll be well limber.” Xander nibbles up a portion of space dust and stares at the pleasant glow of the nearest planet waiting for a ration of worm to chew. The planet’s slow rotation reveals a vast yellow sea with a sparkle reminiscent of gold, divided cleanly by lines formed, in Xander’s head, by impossibly large combs. He imagines the population of this planet making a concerted effort to cover their tracks.</p><p>Xander fumbles through his empty space, the large cube shaped opening in the center of his torso, searching for an itch to scratch. He ends up fondling an organ, holding it like a ball-of-play for a moment before remembering the itch. Xander disconnects his feeding tube and snatches a worm within it to chew then locks the tube to the left side of the hip of his suit. It will be hours before he swims back towards the vessel, to his bunk, to the other five scientists who may or may not speak a word to one another before another cycle of cold sleep.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>For now he takes in the sights of the wakeful hours with a nice chewy wormy, thinking of purer forms of water, contemplating the equations it takes to melt a mass to liquid, and how garishly they all used to gulp it down. What he wouldn’t give for a squeezy pack. Something to rinse the dust other than the innards of worms, the most recent of which presently squirms as Xander wrestles it into place between his back-of-mouth teeth, positioning it perfectly to get the most of its small gush of hydration.</p><p>As Xander’s teeth press down upon its wiggling body, the worm, whose name cannot be pronounced in written words, thinks only of its yesterday, of being launched out of orbit from its stone’s atmosphere - a small rock it and its family had inhabited for as long as the worm could remember. The worm inched along towards a delivery of flexi straws when a sudden rumble announced the presence of a very large and foreign metal claw. The claw edged its way along the dirt fiercely scooping the worm and simultaneously burying the straws it was meant to fetch.</p><p>The frustration over the missed delivery and the general confusion of the situation hardly registered before the weightlessness changed everything the worm knew of its world. The worm separated from the heavy feeling of the surrounding dirt it had been steamrolled into and was suddenly afloat, along with a million particles of ground, each separating from itself like a palm opening. There were many other worms of course, many of whom, like it, were still vomiting, wide-eyed, mouths agape, making their adjustments to anti-gravity, but none of them were this worm’s family.</p><p>More unfamiliar to the worm than the sudden floatation was the metallic encasing of the vessel that sucked it up through the arm of the claw, the blinking lights, and the intoxicating hum of the engine, that sounded like a beggar-beetle’s wings humming as it breezed by. In and out. Two distinct sounds, drawn out like breath all around the worm. It floated wiggling to the profound sensation of touching nothing for what ended up being too short a time before another tube sucked the worm and a few bits of dust towards the mouth where it currently resides. The worm is reminded of this as the dry tongue of Xander slides its body into the vice grip of his teeth. The last thing the worm hears is the wet smack of its insides squeezing out against the mouth of its destructor before experiencing an even more infinite weightlessness.</p><p>Xander swallows the wiggly worm, wiggling no more, and looks through the holes of his five companions’ stomachs. It’s seeped in. You can see stars through each windowed torso, their expanded spaces adding to the darkness. Space is a part of them, emptiness defines them. He resists dwelling on loneliness, and thinks of their resilience while they look deep into each surrounding abyss of their purview. This uncharted space is their land, the stars their flock. Yet, for being the six smartest smarties, they’ve done very little quantifiable research in the past seventy-two years. The scientists can never seem to find a good place to start. They reason that there are too many good places to start, this has generated a massive stall in productivity.</p><p>Beyond the stars are more stars. Beyond that there are galaxies upon galaxies. To imagine that space has no parameters stifles the men when confronted with their exploration: each chosen to document the great and many unknowns in this forever world. Many years ago they were hungry to know what was out there. Now they are simply hungry.</p><p>Xander looks at his vast surroundings as he drifts, the five scientists that represent the last of his people, the sphere that replaced all sense of gravity, the tubes from which they snatch their worms, imagining the taste of frosted cake in his mouth. He is already troubled by his mind’s indulgence, but the thought is there. While he imagines each star as a flickering flame atop a candle buried in icing something unusual enters his periphery.</p><p>There is a sudden absence of stars. Xander adjusts his focus to the darkness, where light does not poke through. As this darkness grows equations rattle off in his mind. Is space moving? Am I drawing nearer to one end of an irrational grid? He looks to his compatriots, each lost in their own bobbing. Each of them staring off. And just as quickly as this absence of light appeared it consumes Qelvin, swallows him whole, he and the chewed bits of space worms and dust within him, gone, forever weightless, homeless, wandering.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content">
  <p>“There is a story of a farm. On the farm melkcore’s were milked. From that milk men were fed, and from that feed seeds were sown. From those seams came me. A melkcore is much like a man, with much less needs...”</p><p>Tate Terje begins all stories about himself with the phrase, “There is a story of a farm.” Tate, how did you come up with the number seven? some someone may ask in response to a mathematical finding, and Tate will begin always at the beginning, “There is a story of a farm...”</p><p>He was eight of eight, the youngest of the flock, born in a third of the time a normal gestation period took. He arrived the size of a peach, throbbing in his Pop-pop’s hand. His body was underdeveloped, his head bald on top with light hair on the sides, like an old man at the start, but his mind throbbed with life. His temples pulsated. It looked as though all blood flowed only to charge his busy mind. He’d grow to full size by the age of twelve, totalling about four feet, eleven inches. He’d lose all the hair his head could grow by his tenth birthday.</p><p>When he was ten Tate devised simple steps to change the flavor of melkcore’s milk while still within the beasts. Typically a melkcore’s raw milk tasted like the thick creamed-pulp of a very bitter lemon. Factories were built to process the stuff. Flavors were sold separately. With Tate’s formulas they became capable of producing pure and natural taste combinations on-farm. Years later the Terje family would go public with Tate’s technique, beginning the flavor age.</p><p>On his eleventh birthday Pop-pop took his young boy atop the tractor and toured the farm as they had done every year on this day since Tate’s first birthday. Tate watched field hands sling picks over their shoulders and into the bedrock. He watched his friends Lawrence and Chuck drag wide combs behind them forming perfect rows in the silt. He watched his friends closely, two men in their fifties, handkerchiefs tied round their necks, wide brimmed hats casting shadows over their faces. He could feel the sweat forming in the crooks of their arms and down their backs, he could see the darkened fabric encroach on the bits that remained dry. Tate took inventory of the wrinkles on each man’s face, tracking the lines that formed once gravity stopped supporting you and started asking for something back.</p><p>Normally birthday cake was not an entity that would survive past the night of its intended use with a family as large as Tate’s. Eight children. Two parents. Four working grandparents. Two surviving Greats! Yet, he managed to slip an extra few slices out of the fray before they were gobbled up. That night the boy was lifted and passed between his brothers and sis, tickled and twisted as he made his way round the family. They told him why he is good and that he is loved and then each of them, one by one, blew on his tummy and kissed the top of his shiny head.</p><p>Tate bided his time in the bedroom that night before slithering out with the extra cake that he stowed away. He snuck his way to the servants’ quarters, no longer needing to graze the guiding string he’d installed years before to make his way around the massive property without getting lost. Memory is a difficult thing to master when you have to work at it.</p><p>The men were up, laid out on their cots, or hovering over a checkerboard, still recovering from the heat of the long solstice sun. Lawrence and Chuck were on the far side of the room, both with a book in one hand and playing cards in the other. Lawrence’s glasses sat low on the tip of his nose. He hardly looked up from the words, yet continued to play the game while acknowledging his young friend in the room, with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>"Do you know any men born on this day, Charles?" he asked Chuck, eyes on page.</p><p>"I believe there are many names one could name," answered Chuck, also not lifting an eye from his page.</p><p>"Well, perhaps we should make a list," replied Lawrence.</p><p>"Oh, I believe I have such a list already started since the last time we spoke of this." Chuck dips his long pointer finger into his shirt-breast-pocket fishing out a tiny scroll of paper, placing it down on the table between them with pinched fingers. Without removing his hold he spreads his fingers away from each other and extends the scroll out. Tate beams at the familiarity of this game. He watches as the list reaches across the table, ready for them to ask him if he has a name to add. Which of course, he does. Once they are through with their playful ignoring Lawrence and Chuck deliver small rocks to the boy with stories of their age.</p><p>“The rings of the purple rock are left by the sun,” says Chuck, “which bleaches its way into the rock year after year, before burning the rest of the rock a darker shade of purple. Sands and stones and the sun and time.” Chuck looks up at the boy. “These are the things to watch.”</p><p>“The other rock,” says Lawrence, “is more deceptive. You have to look within it to find its mysteries. It ages only in darkness, and unlike most things, recedes its energies when confronted by the sun.”</p><p>Tate retrieves the stowed cake and presents the slices to the men. Each man, being the kind of men they were, offered half their slice to the boy, who shook his head before giving in and having a bit extra.</p><p>Tate asks the men if they are tired and they reply, “Yes.” He asks them if he can help and they reply, “How?” He asks them about the comb they drag across the farm day in and out. He asks about the force they use to carry the comb and the weight of the instrument. The men divulge their information, happy to oblige the young sire on his day of birth. And with each bit of information they slowly chip away at their modest slivers of cake and their chances at keeping on here, unbeknownst to the three members of this cheerful party.</p><p>To help his friends Tate eliminates their jobs. He designs a string system that hangs over all sections of the farm. The long combs are held up by twenty foot high stakes with wheels at their ends. The wheels rest on the strings and the strings are pulled by rotating levers. He works well into the week drawing out the system with a ruler for all the lines. He presents the plan to his parents a week later and they discuss its strengths and follies. There is no fault Tate’s Pop-pop can find in the work. They set forth on erecting the system immediately.</p><p>The solstice passes. Lawrence and Chuck drag their comb and watch the crews erect the towering poles that will connect the strings that will take their place. They are too old to work the bedrock and too tired to put up a fight. They will take their comb show elsewhere, hats in hands.</p><p>Tate is eleven years old. He watches the men he delighted in knowing gather their possessions and prepare their beds one last time before leaving the farm. Tate’s brain ticks away inside his skull, pinpointing the precise places where he can destroy the system, one malfunction at a time in order to rehire his friends, but they are already going and gone. His Pop-pop replaces them with two younger fellows that will work for a little less money and who have living quarters a few farms passed this farm while they work out the kinks in the strings that keep mysteriously knotting.</p><p class="text-align-center">~</p>

  <p>The remaining four scientists float to the center of the vessel, eager to move forward. &nbsp;</p><p>Xander: If this isn’t our moment, then I’m not sure what is. &nbsp;</p><p>Eddard: But what of the boy? &nbsp;Should we not wait. &nbsp;</p><p>The scientists look at Eddard, their wiley composer, always wearing the face of a thinking man, his eyebrows forming sharp peaks over his forehead. &nbsp;His hair, a nest of curiosity. &nbsp;</p><p>Quill: We cannot wait. &nbsp;X pronounced Z is right - the moment is upon us. &nbsp;</p><p>Malcolm: What moment? What are you on about?</p><p>Quill: This is an opportunity. An instigation. &nbsp;A message from the great space!</p><p>Xander: Qelvin would want us to.</p><p>Malcolm: Don’t you look to me from the path of grief. &nbsp;It could have been any of us. &nbsp;Would you be using my name in that sentence if my name replaced his name and my body was dangling in the darkness.</p><p>Eddard: Malcolm, do you really think it’s possible, that he’s alive?</p><p>The men are silent. &nbsp;Even the ever angry Malcolm takes a moment for himself, his eyes closed briefly, to offer his compatriot some form of consolation. &nbsp;</p><p>Malcolm: Let’s get it over with then. &nbsp;We are only looking for trouble. &nbsp;We can grieve along the way.</p><p>Eddard: I’ll compose an Elegy.</p><p>The men roll their eyes. &nbsp;</p><p>Xander: And we’ll get to work. &nbsp;Where to?</p><p>Quill: How about that combed planet there. &nbsp;</p><p>Xander: Indeed.</p><p>It has been seventy years, almost three centuries in days of days, of crippling complacency for the six, since their first and only expedition off their vessel. Each passing year the men age while their skin lightens towards translucency, the blue blood beneath it turning them into paler beings than they once were. &nbsp;Their limbs continue to stretch - what they call the noodling - their bodies gradual elongation. Their spaces have expanded to the far reaches of each torso. They eat the same worms, and suck the same space dust, while dragging along in staggering silence.</p><p>The soundlessness is really the killer. Once the innards were outed and their spaces took shape the silence hollowed the emptiness in all aboard the vessel. Qelvin’s disappearance - this darkness, this swallowing up - marks a day of true change. The Six are Five. A reckoning is upon them. &nbsp;</p><h3>It should be said, although they are all kinds of hopeless, that they are learning from their mistakes,&nbsp;now that it is too late...</h3>

  <h1>About.</h1><p>Space People is an ongoing adventure story about a crew of otherworldly male scientists that abandoned their home planet on the eve of its destruction to explore the infinite pockets of space. The so-called smartest of the smarties failed, however, to include a single member of the opposite sex on their voyage. Lost, listless, and lonely the men drift across the endless night sky gathering space dust for nutrients and space worms to drink from. They contemplate their place in the great space while their bodies evolve to existence without gravity.&nbsp;Their torsos are an open box straight through the center of them. Their limbs stretch and expand.</p><p>Not until they decide to explore other worlds do they realize gravity is no longer their ally. Finding themselves borderline useless on land their existence in the world is complicated even further.</p><p>We will be sharing excerpts of the adventure from time to time here, on this website, because the story has worms in it. <em>Of course it has worms in it.&nbsp;</em></p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Let’s Worm is a prompt-based literary art platform. These companion pieces are generated to be digested quickly, prompted by either a write or a draw. Primarily, the writing is considered flash fiction or very short fiction and the illustrations range from sketches to quick color studies. However, we occasionally explore more long-form writing and more in-depth pieces of artwork, you know, for fun.</p>
